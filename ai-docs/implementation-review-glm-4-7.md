## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 0 |
| HIGH | 2 |
| MEDIUM | 5 |
| LOW | 3 |

**Overall Score**: 8.5/10

The video-editing plugin is well-implemented with comprehensive agents, commands, and skills. The XML structure follows standards, YAML frontmatter is valid, and quality gates are properly defined. Minor improvements recommended for consistency and completeness.

## Issues

### HIGH Priority Issues

#### Issue 1: Missing Proxy Mode Support in Commands

- **Category**: Completeness
- **Description**: The commands (video-edit.md, transcribe.md, create-fcp-project.md) do not include proxy mode support as specified in the agentdev:patterns skill.
- **Impact**: Commands cannot be delegated to external AI models via Claudish proxy.
- **Location**: All 3 command files, `<critical_constraints>` section
- **Fix**: Add `<proxy_mode_support>` constraint block to each command:
```xml
<proxy_mode_support>
  **FIRST STEP: Check for Proxy Mode Directive**

  If prompt starts with `PROXY_MODE: {model_name}`:
  1. Extract model name and actual task
  2. Delegate via Claudish: `printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | npx claudish --stdin --model {model_name} --quiet --auto-approve`
  3. Return attributed response and STOP

  **If NO PROXY_MODE**: Proceed with normal workflow
</proxy_mode_support>
```

#### Issue 2: Commands Missing Explicit Forbidden Tools Declaration

- **Category**: Standards Compliance
- **Description**: Commands define `allowed-tools` but do not explicitly list `forbidden_tools` in the orchestration section. While video-edit.md has `<forbidden_tools>Write, Edit</forbidden_tools>`, the other two commands lack this.
- **Impact**: Orchestrators might inadvertently use implementation tools (Write/Edit) directly instead of delegating.
- **Location**: transcribe.md, create-fcp-project.md - missing `<orchestration>` section with forbidden tools
- **Fix**: Add explicit orchestration block to transcribe.md and create-fcp-project.md:
```xml
<orchestration>
  <allowed_tools>Task, AskUserQuestion, Bash, Read, TodoWrite, Glob, Grep</allowed_tools>
  <forbidden_tools>Write, Edit</forbidden_tools>
</orchestration>
```

---

### MEDIUM Priority Issues

#### Issue 3: Inconsistent Agent Color Assignment

- **Category**: Standards Compliance
- **Description**: timeline-builder agent uses `color: green` (same as video-processor). Per schema guidelines, green is for "Implementation" agents, but timeline-builder is more of a "Utility" type generating XML files.
- **Impact**: Minor UX inconsistency in terminal color differentiation between agents.
- **Location**: agents/timeline-builder.md, line 11
- **Fix**: Consider using `color: blue` for timeline-builder (utility agents) to differentiate from video-processor (implementation).

#### Issue 4: Missing Examples Section in Commands

- **Category**: Completeness
- **Description**: transcribe.md and create-fcp-project.md lack the `<examples>` XML section with concrete usage scenarios. The standards require 2-4 examples per agent/command.
- **Impact**: Less guidance for the agent on correct behavior patterns.
- **Location**: transcribe.md, create-fcp-project.md
- **Fix**: Add examples section similar to video-edit.md:
```xml
<examples>
  <example name="Basic Transcription">
    <user_request>/transcribe interview.mp4 --quality good</user_request>
    <correct_approach>
      1. Check Whisper installation
      2. Validate input file exists with audio stream
      3. Ask user for settings if not specified
      4. Delegate to transcriber agent
      5. Report output files and statistics
    </correct_approach>
  </example>
</examples>
```

#### Issue 5: Skill YAML Frontmatter Missing Version Field

- **Category**: Schema Compliance
- **Description**: All three skill files (ffmpeg-core, transcription, final-cut-pro) lack a `version` field in their YAML frontmatter. While not strictly required, it aids in tracking skill updates.
- **Impact**: Difficulty tracking skill versions for updates.
- **Location**: skills/*/SKILL.md files
- **Fix**: Add version field:
```yaml
---
name: ffmpeg-core
version: 1.0.0
description: ...
---
```

#### Issue 6: Plugin.json Missing Repository and Homepage Fields

- **Category**: Manifest Completeness
- **Description**: plugin.json lacks `repository` and `homepage` fields which are useful for discoverability and maintenance.
- **Impact**: Users cannot easily find documentation or report issues.
- **Location**: plugin.json
- **Fix**: Add repository info:
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/MadAppGang/magus"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/MadAppGang/magus/tree/main/plugins/video-editing"
}
```

#### Issue 7: Commands Missing Error Recovery Strategies

- **Category**: Completeness
- **Description**: transcribe.md and create-fcp-project.md lack `<error_recovery>` sections. Only video-edit.md has comprehensive error recovery strategies.
- **Impact**: Less resilient handling of failures in transcription and FCP commands.
- **Location**: transcribe.md, create-fcp-project.md
- **Fix**: Add error recovery section:
```xml
<error_recovery>
  <strategy name="whisper_not_installed">
    Provide installation instructions.
    Offer to proceed with alternative or abort.
  </strategy>
  <strategy name="agent_failure">
    Capture error from transcriber agent.
    Report to user with context.
    Suggest retry or alternative approach.
  </strategy>
</error_recovery>
```

---

### LOW Priority Issues

#### Issue 8: Inconsistent Markdown Heading Levels in Skills

- **Category**: Formatting
- **Description**: Skills use slightly inconsistent heading structures. ffmpeg-core uses H2 for main sections, but some subsections jump from H2 to H4.
- **Impact**: Minor readability issue.
- **Location**: skills/ffmpeg-core/SKILL.md, line 99-113
- **Fix**: Use consistent H2 -> H3 -> H4 progression.

#### Issue 9: README Could Include Architecture Diagram

- **Category**: Documentation
- **Description**: The README is comprehensive but lacks a visual architecture diagram showing the relationship between commands, agents, and skills.
- **Impact**: Harder for new users to understand plugin structure at a glance.
- **Location**: README.md
- **Fix**: Add ASCII or Mermaid diagram:
```
Commands (Orchestrators)
    |
    +-- /video-edit
    |       |
    +-- /transcribe
    |       |
    +-- /create-fcp-project
            |
            v
Agents (Workers)
    |
    +-- video-processor (FFmpeg)
    +-- transcriber (Whisper)
    +-- timeline-builder (FCPXML)
            |
            v
Skills (Knowledge)
    +-- ffmpeg-core
    +-- transcription
    +-- final-cut-pro
```

#### Issue 10: Agents Missing Explicit Model Recommendation Justification

- **Category**: Documentation
- **Description**: All agents use `model: sonnet` without explaining why (cost/quality tradeoff). Adding a comment would help maintainers understand the choice.
- **Impact**: Minor - no functional issue.
- **Location**: All agent files
- **Fix**: Add brief comment in description or use a note:
```yaml
model: sonnet  # Balanced cost/quality for video processing tasks
```

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Before Production)

1. **Add proxy mode support** to all commands for multi-model flexibility
2. **Add forbidden_tools** declarations to transcribe.md and create-fcp-project.md

### Priority 2 (Soon)

3. **Add examples section** to transcribe.md and create-fcp-project.md
4. **Add error_recovery** strategies to transcribe.md and create-fcp-project.md
5. **Add version field** to skill YAML frontmatter

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)

6. **Add repository/homepage** to plugin.json
7. **Differentiate timeline-builder color** from video-processor
8. **Add architecture diagram** to README.md

---

## Approval Decision

**Status**: PASS

**Rationale**:
- 0 CRITICAL issues
- 2 HIGH issues (both are enhancements for flexibility, not blockers)
- All core functionality is properly implemented
- TodoWrite integration is excellent throughout
- Quality gates are present with clear exit criteria
- XML structure follows standards
- YAML frontmatter is valid

**Recommendation**: Approve for production use. Address HIGH priority issues in next iteration to enable proxy mode and improve consistency.
