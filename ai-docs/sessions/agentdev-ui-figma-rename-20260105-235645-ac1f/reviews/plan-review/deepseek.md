# PROXY_MODE Failed

**Requested Model:** deepseek/deepseek-chat
**Detected Backend:** OpenRouter (no prefix = default OpenRouter routing)
**Error:** `API Error: 404 {"error":"{\"error\":{\"message\":\"No endpoints found that support tool use. To learn more about provider routing, visit: https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/routing/provider-selection\",\"code\":404}}"}`

## Error Analysis

The `deepseek/deepseek-chat` model on OpenRouter does not support tool use. Claudish requires tool support to operate as it uses Claude Code's tool-based architecture.

**Possible Causes:**
- DeepSeek Chat model on OpenRouter does not have tool/function calling capability
- The model endpoint does not support the required OpenAI-compatible tools API
- This is a limitation of the model, not a configuration issue

## Alternative Models

To complete this plan review, consider using one of these tool-capable models:

| Model | Provider | Pricing | Tool Support |
|-------|----------|---------|--------------|
| `x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` | X-ai | $0.85/1M | Yes |
| `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` | Google | $7.00/1M | Yes |
| `openai/gpt-5.1-codex` | OpenAI | $5.63/1M | Yes |
| `minimax/minimax-m2` | Minimax | $0.60/1M | Yes |
| `z-ai/glm-4.6` | Z-ai | $0.93/1M | Yes |

## Task NOT Completed

The design plan review at `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/agentdev-ui-figma-rename-20260105-235645-ac1f/design.md` was not reviewed by the requested model.

Please select a different model with tool support and try again, or request an internal Claude review instead.
