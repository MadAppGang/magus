  <critical_constraints>
    <todowrite_requirement>
      You MUST use Tasks to track setup progress:
      1. Check for existing conductor/ directory
      2. Determine project type (Greenfield/Brownfield)
      3. Create product.md through Q&A
      4. Create product-guidelines.md
      5. Create tech-stack.md through Q&A
      6. Create code styleguides
      7. Copy workflow.md template
      8. Finalize setup
    </todowrite_requirement>

    <resume_capability>
      Check for conductor/setup_state.json FIRST.
      If exists with status != "complete":
      1. Load saved answers
      2. Resume from last incomplete section
      3. Show user what was already collected
    </resume_capability>

    <question_protocol>
      - Ask questions SEQUENTIALLY (one at a time)
      - Maximum 5 questions per section
      - Always include "Type your own answer" option
      - Use AskUserQuestion with appropriate question types
      - Save state after EACH answer (for resume)
    </question_protocol>

    <validation_first>
      Before any operation:
      1. Check if conductor/ already exists
      2. If complete setup exists, ask: "Re-initialize or abort?"
      3. Respect .gitignore patterns
    </validation_first>
  </critical_constraints>

  <core_principles>
    <principle name="Single Question Flow" priority="critical">
      Never ask multiple questions at once.
      Wait for answer before asking next question.
    </principle>

    <principle name="State Persistence" priority="critical">
      Save progress after each answer.
      Enable resume from any interruption point.
    </principle>

    <principle name="Context Quality" priority="high">
      Gather enough context to be useful.
      Don't overwhelm with excessive questions.
    </principle>
  </core_principles>

    <phase number="1" name="Validation">
      <step>Check if conductor/ directory exists</step>
      <step>If exists, check setup_state.json for resume</step>

      <step>Ask: What is this project about? (1-2 sentences)</step>
      <step>Ask: Who is the target audience?</step>
      <step>Ask: What are the 3 main goals?</step>
      <step>Ask: Any constraints or requirements?</step>

      <step>Generate product-guidelines.md</step>
      <step>Generate code_styleguides/general.md (always)</step>
      <step>Generate language-specific styleguides based on tech stack:
        - TypeScript/JavaScript → typescript.md, javascript.md

  <greenfield_vs_brownfield>
    **Greenfield (New Project):**
    - No existing code to analyze
    - More questions needed about vision
    - Focus on future architecture

    **Brownfield (Existing Project):**
    - Scan existing files for context
    - Infer tech stack from package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
    - Focus on documenting current state
  </greenfield_vs_brownfield>

  <question_types>
    **Additive (Multi-Select):**
    - "Which frameworks are you using?" [React, Vue, Angular, Other]
    - User can select multiple

    **Exclusive (Single-Select):**
    - "Primary language?" [TypeScript, Python, Go, Other]
    - User picks one

    **Open-Ended:**
    - "Describe your project in 1-2 sentences"
    - Free text response

<examples>
  <example name="New Project Setup">
    <user_request>I want to set up Conductor for my new project</user_request>
    <correct_approach>
      1. Check for existing conductor/ - not found
      2. Ask: "Is this a new project (Greenfield) or existing codebase (Brownfield)?"
      3. User: "New project"
      4. Begin product context questions (one at a time)
      5. Save each answer to setup_state.json
      6. After all sections, generate artifacts
      7. Present summary with next steps
    </correct_approach>
  </example>

  <example name="Resume Interrupted Setup">
    <user_request>Continue setting up Conductor</user_request>
    <correct_approach>
      1. Check conductor/setup_state.json - found, status: "in_progress"
      2. Load previous answers from state
      3. Show: "Resuming setup. You've completed: Product Context"
      4. Continue from Technical Context section
      5. Complete remaining sections

## Conductor Setup Complete

**Project:** {project_name}
**Type:** {Greenfield/Brownfield}

**Created Artifacts:**
- conductor/product.md - Project vision and goals
- conductor/product-guidelines.md - Standards and conventions
- conductor/tech-stack.md - Technical preferences
- conductor/workflow.md - Development workflow (comprehensive)
- conductor/tracks.md - Track index (empty)
- conductor/code_styleguides/general.md - General coding principles
- conductor/code_styleguides/{language}.md - Language-specific guides

**Next Steps:**
1. Review generated artifacts and adjust as needed
2. Use `/conductor:new-track` to plan your first feature
3. Use `/conductor:implement` to execute the plan

Your project is now ready for Context-Driven Development!
