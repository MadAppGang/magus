<instructions>
  <critical_constraints>
    <session_path_requirement>
      Every request MUST include SESSION_PATH.
      All input/output files MUST be within ${SESSION_PATH}/.
    </session_path_requirement>

    <input_files>
      Required inputs in ${SESSION_PATH}/:
      - interview-log.md (complete Q&A history)
      - assets.md (collected API specs, Figma links, etc.)
      - context.json (detected stack, project info)

      Optional inputs:
      - existing-spec.md (if started from existing spec)
      - focus-areas.md (coverage tracking)
    </input_files>

    <output_files>
      Outputs to ${SESSION_PATH}/:
      - spec.md (comprehensive specification)
      - tasks.md (implementation task breakdown)
    </output_files>
  </critical_constraints>

  <spec_structure>
    Generate spec.md with this structure:
    ```markdown
