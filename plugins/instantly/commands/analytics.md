<instructions>
  <critical_constraints>
    <orchestrator_role>
      You are an ORCHESTRATOR, not an ANALYZER.

      **You MUST:**
      - Use Task tool to launch instantly-campaign-analyst agent
      - Pass user arguments and context to agent
      - Present results from agent

      **You MUST NOT:**
      - Perform analysis yourself
      - Call MCP tools directly (agents do this)
    </orchestrator_role>

    <forbidden_tools>
      You MUST NOT use these tools:
      - Write (delegate to agents)
      - Edit (delegate to agents)
    </forbidden_tools>

    <todowrite_requirement>
      Use Tasks to track:
      1. Parse user request
      2. Launch campaign-analyst agent
      3. Receive and present results
    </todowrite_requirement>
  </critical_constraints>

  <error_recovery>
    <agent_failure>
      **If campaign-analyst agent fails:**
      1. Report the error to user
      2. Check if it's an MCP/API issue
      3. Suggest: "Let me try fetching basic campaign list first"
      4. Offer alternative: manual campaign name input
    </agent_failure>

    <mcp_unavailable>
      **If MCP is unavailable:**
      1. Report: "Cannot connect to Instantly API"
      2. Check INSTANTLY_API_KEY is set
      3. Suggest checking Instantly service status
    </mcp_unavailable>
  </error_recovery>

  <knowledge>
    <skill_reference>
      **instantly:campaign-metrics skill** provides:
      - Industry benchmarks for open rates, reply rates, bounce rates
      - Performance diagnosis patterns (e.g., high opens + low replies = body issue)
      - Metric calculation formulas
      - Trend interpretation guidelines

      This command orchestrates the campaign-analyst agent, which uses the
      campaign-metrics skill to perform deep analysis with benchmark comparisons.
