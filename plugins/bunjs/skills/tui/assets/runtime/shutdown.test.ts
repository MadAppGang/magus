/**
 * Teardown tests for `installShutdown`. Every one fires on a SPECIFIC regression in the
 * quit path, because that path is the one an app cannot recover from: a shutdown that
 * throws half-way leaves the terminal in raw mode inside the alternate screen, and the
 * reader's next prompt needs `reset` to come back.
 *
 * THE EXIT-PATH TESTS RUN IN SUBPROCESSES AND SEND REAL SIGNALS. They have to. This file
 * has been believed correct and been wrong three times, and each time the belief rested
 * on mocks: a stubbed `process.exit` proves the function was reached, not that the process
 * ended; a hand-called handler proves nothing about WHO the kernel delivers a signal to
 * when two owners registered for it. So the child sends itself a real signal, records
 * each step to a file with `appendFileSync` (synchronous, so `process.exit` cannot
 * truncate it, and immune to the renderer's stdout capture), and the parent asserts the
 * exact order and the exact exit code.
 *
 * Every child arms a REF'D 4s guard timer that exits 99. That is the negative control: a
 * teardown that never reaches `process.exit` reports 99 instead of drifting out with a
 * misleading 0, so a green result here cannot be vacuous.
 *
 * The in-process stubs are `Pick<CliRenderer, "destroy">` / `Pick<Root, "unmount">`, which
 * the signature admits directly — no `as unknown as` cast, and a cast is exactly what
 * stops anyone writing these tests. */
