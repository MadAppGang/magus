Overall, the plugin manifests demonstrate **good quality** with consistent patterns, but there are **significant inconsistencies** in field usage, format, and required fields that need standardization.\\n\\n**Key Findings**:\\n- ✅ All files are valid JSON with no syntax errors\\n- ✅ All required fields (name, version, description) present\\n- ✅ Version format is consistent (semantic versioning)\\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent agent reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent command reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field presence (author, license, homepage, tags vs keywords)\\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field ordering across plugins\\n- ⚠️ Mixed use of \\\"tags\\\" vs \\\"keywords\\\" fields\\n- ⚠️ Some plugins use inline hooks objects, others use file references\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis by Plugin\\n\\n### 1. **instantly** (v1.0.1)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 2. **frontend** (v3.14.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: instantly, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 3. **bun** (v1.6.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 4. **code-analysis** (v3.2.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference (.mcp.json)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 5. **agentdev** (v1.5.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- **CRITICAL**: agents field is array of strings (directory names only): `[\\\"architect\\\", \\\"developer\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\"]`\\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field uses file references: `[\\\"./commands/develop.md\\\", ...]`\\n- **Mixed format within same file** - agents don't match commands\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Uses: inline hooks object instead of file reference\\n- Has: dependencies, compatibility\\n- **Different from all other plugins**\\n\\n### 6. **seo** (v1.6.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference, dependencies\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 7. **conductor** (v2.1.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field is array of strings (names only): `[\\\"setup\\\", \\\"new-track\\\", ...]`\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Has: empty skills array, empty dependencies array, compatibility\\n- **Different from most plugins**\\n\\n### 8. **nanobanana** (v2.3.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, video-editing\\n\\n### 9. **video-editing** (v1.1.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana\\n\\n### 10. **autopilot** (v0.2.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Very Good (most comprehensive)\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, dependencies\\n- **Extra fields** (good additions): npmDependencies, compatibility, envVars (with detailed schema)\\n- Most complete schema of all plugins\\n\\n### 11. **dev** (v1.29.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference, dependencies, compatibility\\n- **Extra field**: outputStyles (unique to this plugin)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo\\n\\n### 12. **multimodel** (v2.2.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Uses: hooks file reference\\n- Has: dependencies (empty object), compatibility\\n- **Extra field**: skillBundles (good pattern for grouping)\\n- **Missing**: commands field uses standard file-based references (good)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### 1. **Agent Reference Format Inconsistency**\\n\\n**File-based references (10 plugins)**: `[\\\"./agents/developer.md\\\", \\\"./agents/architect.md\\\"]`\\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel (no agents)\\n\\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\\\"architect\\\", \\\"developer\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\"]`\\n- ❌ agentdev\\n\\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads agents\\n\\n### 2. **Command Reference Format Inconsistency**\\n\\n**File-based references (11 plugins)**: `[\\\"./commands/help.md\\\", \\\"./commands/setup.md\\\"]`\\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, agentdev, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel\\n\\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\\\"setup\\\", \\\"new-track\\\", \\\"implement\\\"]`\\n- ❌ conductor\\n\\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads commands\\n\\n### 3. **Keywords vs Tags Field**\\n\\n**Uses \\\"keywords\\\"** (7 plugins): instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n**Uses \\\"tags\\\"** (3 plugins): agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n**Impact**: Medium - affects searchability and categorization\\n\\n### 4. **Author Field Format**\\n\\n**Author as object** (9 plugins):\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n- instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n\\n**Author as string** (3 plugins): `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n- agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n**Impact**: Low - both valid, but object format is more informative\\n\\n### 5. **Hooks Field Format**\\n\\n**Hooks as file reference** (6 plugins): `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n- instantly, code-analysis, seo, autopilot, multimodel\\n\\n**Hooks as inline object** (1 plugin): Full hook configuration inline\\n- agentdev\\n\\n**No hooks** (5 plugins): frontend, bun, nanobanana, video-editing, conductor, dev\\n\\n**Impact**: Low - both valid patterns, but file reference is cleaner\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Missing Fields Analysis\\n\\n### Optional but Recommended Fields\\n\\n| Field | Present In | Missing From |\\n|-------|-----------|--------------|\\n| **category** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| **license** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| **homepage** | 3 plugins | 9 plugins (instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, dev, autopilot) |\\n| **dependencies** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n| **compatibility** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n| **mcpServers** | 7 plugins | 5 plugins (agentdev, conductor, nanobanana, video-editing, multimodel) |\\n| **hooks** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Field Ordering Inconsistency\\n\\nThere is **no consistent field order** across plugins. Suggested standard order:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {},\\n  \\\"license\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"keywords\\\": [],\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {},\\n  \\\"npmDependencies\\\": {},\\n  \\\"compatibility\\\": {},\\n  \\\"agents\\\": [],\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [],\\n  \\\"skills\\\": [],\\n  \\\"outputStyles\\\": [],\\n  \\\"skillBundles\\\": {},\\n  \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"envVars\\\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best Practices Violations\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent reference format**: Some plugins use directory names, others use file paths\\n2. **Mixed terminology**: \\\"keywords\\\" vs \\\"tags\\\" for the same purpose\\n3. **Missing category field**: Makes marketplace categorization inconsistent\\n4. **Missing license field**: Important for open source compliance\\n5. **No standard field order**: Makes manual review difficult\\n6. **Inconsistent author format**: String vs object\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Positive Patterns Observed\\n\\n1. ✅ **autopilot envVars schema**: Best practice for documenting environment variables\\n2. ✅ **multimodel skillBundles**: Good pattern for grouping related skills\\n3. ✅ **dev outputStyles**: Good pattern for customization\\n4. ✅ **Semantic versioning**: All plugins follow semver correctly\\n5. ✅ **File-based component references**: Most plugins use this (good for maintainability)\\n6. ✅ **Author object format**: More informative than string-only\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### High Priority (Breaking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Standardize agent references**: All plugins should use `[\\\"./agents/name.md\\\"]` format\\n   - Fix: agentdev agents field\\n\\n2. **Standardize command references**: All plugins should use `[\\\"./commands/name.md\\\"]` format\\n   - Fix: conductor commands field\\n\\n3. **Standardize keywords vs tags**: Choose one field name (recommend \\\"keywords\\\")\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Medium Priority (Consistency)\\n\\n4. **Standardize author format**: Use object format with name, email, company\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n5. **Add missing category field**: All plugins should have category\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n6. **Add missing license field**: All plugins should have explicit license\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Low Priority (Nice to Have)\\n\\n7. **Standardize field ordering**: Apply consistent order across all plugins\\n\\n8. **Add homepage to all plugins**: Link to GitHub/documentation\\n\\n9. **Document environment variables**: Use autopilot's envVars pattern\\n\\n10. **Add compatibility field**: Document minimum Claude Code version\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggested Schema (Based on Analysis)\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"semver string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n

Linting**: Add pre-commit hook to validate plugin.json format\\n3. **Documentation**: Create PLUGIN_JSON_SCHEMA.md with official format specification\\n4. **Migration Guide**: Create migration guide for fixing agentdev and conductor formats\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Multiple plugins have critical format inconsistencies (agentdev agents, conductor commands, keywords vs tags) that must be standardized for Claude Code compatibility and maintainability.\\nKEY_ISSUES: agentdev agents format (strings vs files), conductor commands format (strings vs files),

Overall, the plugin manifests demonstrate **good quality** with consistent patterns, but there are **significant inconsistencies** in field usage, format, and required fields that need standardization.\\n\\n**Key Findings**:\\n- ✅ All files are valid JSON with no syntax errors\\n- ✅ All required fields (name, version, description) present\\n- ✅ Version format is consistent (semantic versioning)\\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent agent reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent command reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field presence (author, license, homepage, tags vs keywords)\\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field ordering across plugins\\n- ⚠️ Mixed use of \\\"tags\\\" vs \\\"keywords\\\" fields\\n- ⚠️ Some plugins use inline hooks objects, others use file references\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis by Plugin\\n\\n### 1. **instantly** (v1.0.1)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 2. **frontend** (v3.14.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: instantly, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 3. **bun** (v1.6.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 4. **code-analysis** (v3.2.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference (.mcp.json)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 5. **agentdev** (v1.5.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- **CRITICAL**: agents field is array of strings (directory names only): `[\\\"architect\\\", \\\"developer\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\"]`\\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field uses file references: `[\\\"./commands/develop.md\\\", ...]`\\n- **Mixed format within same file** - agents don't match commands\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Uses: inline hooks object instead of file reference\\n- Has: dependencies, compatibility\\n- **Different from all other plugins**\\n\\n### 6. **seo** (v1.6.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference, dependencies\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 7. **conductor** (v2.1.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field is array of strings (names only): `[\\\"setup\\\", \\\"new-track\\\", ...]`\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Has: empty skills array, empty dependencies array, compatibility\\n- **Different from most plugins**\\n\\n### 8. **nanobanana** (v2.3.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, video-editing\\n\\n### 9. **video-editing** (v1.1.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana\\n\\n### 10. **autopilot** (v0.2.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Very Good (most comprehensive)\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, dependencies\\n- **Extra fields** (good additions): npmDependencies, compatibility, envVars (with detailed schema)\\n- Most complete schema of all plugins\\n\\n### 11. **dev** (v1.29.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference, dependencies, compatibility\\n- **Extra field**: outputStyles (unique to this plugin)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo\\n\\n### 12. **multimodel** (v2.2.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Uses: hooks file reference\\n- Has: dependencies (empty object), compatibility\\n- **Extra field**: skillBundles (good pattern for grouping)\\n- **Missing**: commands field uses standard file-based references (good)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### 1. **Agent Reference Format Inconsistency**\\n\\n**File-based references (10 plugins)**: `[\\\"./agents/developer.md\\\", \\\"./agents/architect.md\\\"]`\\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel (no agents)\\n\\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\\\"architect\\\", \\\"developer\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\"]`\\n- ❌ agentdev\\n\\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads agents\\n\\n### 2. **Command Reference Format Inconsistency**\\n\\n**File-based references (11 plugins)**: `[\\\"./commands/help.md\\\", \\\"./commands/setup.md\\\"]`\\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, agentdev, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel\\n\\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\\\"setup\\\", \\\"new-track\\\", \\\"implement\\\"]`\\n- ❌ conductor\\n\\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads commands\\n\\n### 3. **Keywords vs Tags Field**\\n\\n**Uses \\\"keywords\\\"** (7 plugins): instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n**Uses \\\"tags\\\"** (3 plugins): agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n**Impact**: Medium - affects searchability and categorization\\n\\n### 4. **Author Field Format**\\n\\n**Author as object** (9 plugins):\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n- instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n\\n**Author as string** (3 plugins): `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n- agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n**Impact**: Low - both valid, but object format is more informative\\n\\n### 5. **Hooks Field Format**\\n\\n**Hooks as file reference** (6 plugins): `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n- instantly, code-analysis, seo, autopilot, multimodel\\n\\n**Hooks as inline object** (1 plugin): Full hook configuration inline\\n- agentdev\\n\\n**No hooks** (5 plugins): frontend, bun, nanobanana, video-editing, conductor, dev\\n\\n**Impact**: Low - both valid patterns, but file reference is cleaner\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Missing Fields Analysis\\n\\n### Optional but Recommended Fields\\n\\n| Field | Present In | Missing From |\\n|-------|-----------|--------------|\\n| **category** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| **license** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| **homepage** | 3 plugins | 9 plugins (instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, dev, autopilot) |\\n| **dependencies** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n| **compatibility** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n| **mcpServers** | 7 plugins | 5 plugins (agentdev, conductor, nanobanana, video-editing, multimodel) |\\n| **hooks** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Field Ordering Inconsistency\\n\\nThere is **no consistent field order** across plugins. Suggested standard order:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {},\\n  \\\"license\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"keywords\\\": [],\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {},\\n  \\\"npmDependencies\\\": {},\\n  \\\"compatibility\\\": {},\\n  \\\"agents\\\": [],\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [],\\n  \\\"skills\\\": [],\\n  \\\"outputStyles\\\": [],\\n  \\\"skillBundles\\\": {},\\n  \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"envVars\\\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best Practices Violations\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent reference format**: Some plugins use directory names, others use file paths\\n2. **Mixed terminology**: \\\"keywords\\\" vs \\\"tags\\\" for the same purpose\\n3. **Missing category field**: Makes marketplace categorization inconsistent\\n4. **Missing license field**: Important for open source compliance\\n5. **No standard field order**: Makes manual review difficult\\n6. **Inconsistent author format**: String vs object\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Positive Patterns Observed\\n\\n1. ✅ **autopilot envVars schema**: Best practice for documenting environment variables\\n2. ✅ **multimodel skillBundles**: Good pattern for grouping related skills\\n3. ✅ **dev outputStyles**: Good pattern for customization\\n4. ✅ **Semantic versioning**: All plugins follow semver correctly\\n5. ✅ **File-based component references**: Most plugins use this (good for maintainability)\\n6. ✅ **Author object format**: More informative than string-only\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### High Priority (Breaking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Standardize agent references**: All plugins should use `[\\\"./agents/name.md\\\"]` format\\n   - Fix: agentdev agents field\\n\\n2. **Standardize command references**: All plugins should use `[\\\"./commands/name.md\\\"]` format\\n   - Fix: conductor commands field\\n\\n3. **Standardize keywords vs tags**: Choose one field name (recommend \\\"keywords\\\")\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Medium Priority (Consistency)\\n\\n4. **Standardize author format**: Use object format with name, email, company\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n5. **Add missing category field**: All plugins should have category\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n6. **Add missing license field**: All plugins should have explicit license\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Low Priority (Nice to Have)\\n\\n7. **Standardize field ordering**: Apply consistent order across all plugins\\n\\n8. **Add homepage to all plugins**: Link to GitHub/documentation\\n\\n9. **Document environment variables**: Use autopilot's envVars pattern\\n\\n10. **Add compatibility field**: Document minimum Claude Code version\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggested Schema (Based on Analysis)\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\":

Linting**: Add pre-commit hook to validate plugin.json format\\n3. **Documentation**: Create PLUGIN_JSON_SCHEMA.md with official format specification\\n4. **Migration Guide**: Create migration guide for fixing agentdev and conductor formats\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Multiple plugins have critical format inconsistencies (agentdev agents, conductor commands, keywords vs tags) that must be standardized for Claude Code compatibility and maintainability.\\nKEY_ISSUES: agentdev agents format (strings vs files), conductor commands format (strings vs files),

Examine each plugin.json file under plugins/*/plugin.json for:\n- JSON schema correctness and consistency\n- Required fields present (name, version, description)\n- Version format consistency\n- Naming conventions\n- Field ordering consistency across plugins\n- Any deprecated or unnecessary fields\n- Best practices for Claude Code plugin manifests\n\n### Context\nThere are 12 plugin.json files to review:\n- plugins/instantly/plugin.json\n- plugins/frontend/plugin.json\n- plugins/bun/plugin.json\n- plugins/code-analysis/plugin.json\n- plugins/agentdev/plugin.json\n- plugins/seo/plugin.json\n- plugins/conductor/plugin.json\n- plugins/nanobanana/plugin.json\n- plugins/video-editing/plugin.json\n- plugins/autopilot/plugin.json\n- plugins/dev/plugin.json\n- plugins/multimodel/plugin.json\n\nRead ALL 12 files and do a thorough quality review.\n\n### Your Assignment\n\n1. **Analyze** each plugin.json file objectively\n2. **Identify** any issues, concerns, or strengths\n3. **Cast your vote** in the required format\n\n### Required Vote Format\n\nYou MUST end your response with a vote block:\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: [APPROVE|REJECT|ABSTAIN]\nCONFIDENCE: [1-10]\nSUMMARY: [One sentence explaining your vote]\nKEY_ISSUES: [Comma-separated list, or \"None\"]\n```\n\n### Voting Guidelines\n\n- **APPROVE**: Plugin.json files meet requirements, no blocking issues\n- **REJECT**: Significant issues that must be addressed\n- **ABSTAIN**: Cannot make determination (missing context, ambiguous requirements)\n\nBe decisive. Abstain only when truly unable to evaluate.\n\nWrite your complete analysis and vote to: ai-docs/sessions/team-review-plugin-json-q-20260210-141618-b78253d6/internal-result.md","result":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"2807edae-3175-4d0a-b959-b34dbbe8e890\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"abaf4d0\",\"slug\":\"compressed-splashing-flame\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nReview the code quality of all plugin.json files in this repository.

Overall, the plugin manifests demonstrate **good quality** with consistent patterns, but there are **significant inconsistencies** in field usage, format, and required fields that need standardization.\\n\\n**Key Findings**:\\n- ✅ All files are valid JSON with no syntax errors\\n- ✅ All required fields (name, version, description) present\\n- ✅ Version format is consistent (semantic versioning)\\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent agent reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent command reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field presence (author, license, homepage, tags vs keywords)\\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field ordering across plugins\\n- ⚠️ Mixed use of \\\"tags\\\" vs \\\"keywords\\\" fields\\n- ⚠️ Some plugins use inline hooks objects, others use file references\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis by Plugin\\n\\n### 1. **instantly** (v1.0.1)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 2. **frontend** (v3.14.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: instantly, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 3. **bun** (v1.6.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 4. **code-analysis** (v3.2.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference (.mcp.json)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 5. **agentdev** (v1.5.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- **CRITICAL**: agents field is array of strings (directory names only): `[\\\"architect\\\", \\\"developer\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\"]`\\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field uses file references: `[\\\"./commands/develop.md\\\", ...]`\\n- **Mixed format within same file** - agents don't match commands\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Uses: inline hooks object instead of file reference\\n- Has: dependencies, compatibility\\n- **Different from all other plugins**\\n\\n### 6. **seo** (v1.6.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference, dependencies\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, nanobanana, video-editing\\n\\n### 7. **conductor** (v2.1.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field is array of strings (names only): `[\\\"setup\\\", \\\"new-track\\\", ...]`\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Has: empty skills array, empty dependencies array, compatibility\\n- **Different from most plugins**\\n\\n### 8. **nanobanana** (v2.3.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, video-editing\\n\\n### 9. **video-editing** (v1.1.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana\\n\\n### 10. **autopilot** (v0.2.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Very Good (most comprehensive)\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: hooks file reference, dependencies\\n- **Extra fields** (good additions): npmDependencies, compatibility, envVars (with detailed schema)\\n- Most complete schema of all plugins\\n\\n### 11. **dev** (v1.29.0)\\n**Status**: ✅ Good\\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference, dependencies, compatibility\\n- **Extra field**: outputStyles (unique to this plugin)\\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo\\n\\n### 12. **multimodel** (v2.2.0)\\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\\n- Uses: \\\"tags\\\" instead of \\\"keywords\\\"\\n- Uses: \\\"author\\\" as string instead of object\\n- Uses: hooks file reference\\n- Has: dependencies (empty object), compatibility\\n- **Extra field**: skillBundles (good pattern for grouping)\\n- **Missing**: commands field uses standard file-based references (good)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### 1. **Agent Reference Format Inconsistency**\\n\\n**File-based references (10 plugins)**: `[\\\"./agents/developer.md\\\", \\\"./agents/architect.md\\\"]`\\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel (no agents)\\n\\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\\\"architect\\\", \\\"developer\\\", \\\"reviewer\\\"]`\\n- ❌ agentdev\\n\\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads agents\\n\\n### 2. **Command Reference Format Inconsistency**\\n\\n**File-based references (11 plugins)**: `[\\\"./commands/help.md\\\", \\\"./commands/setup.md\\\"]`\\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, agentdev, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel\\n\\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\\\"setup\\\", \\\"new-track\\\", \\\"implement\\\"]`\\n- ❌ conductor\\n\\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads commands\\n\\n### 3. **Keywords vs Tags Field**\\n\\n**Uses \\\"keywords\\\"** (7 plugins): instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n**Uses \\\"tags\\\"** (3 plugins): agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n**Impact**: Medium - affects searchability and categorization\\n\\n### 4. **Author Field Format**\\n\\n**Author as object** (9 plugins):\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n- instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n\\n**Author as string** (3 plugins): `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n- agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n**Impact**: Low - both valid, but object format is more informative\\n\\n### 5. **Hooks Field Format**\\n\\n**Hooks as file reference** (6 plugins): `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n- instantly, code-analysis, seo, autopilot, multimodel\\n\\n**Hooks as inline object** (1 plugin): Full hook configuration inline\\n- agentdev\\n\\n**No hooks** (5 plugins): frontend, bun, nanobanana, video-editing, conductor, dev\\n\\n**Impact**: Low - both valid patterns, but file reference is cleaner\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Missing Fields Analysis\\n\\n### Optional but Recommended Fields\\n\\n| Field | Present In | Missing From |\\n|-------|-----------|--------------|\\n| **category** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| **license** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| **homepage** | 3 plugins | 9 plugins (instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, dev, autopilot) |\\n| **dependencies** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n| **compatibility** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n| **mcpServers** | 7 plugins | 5 plugins (agentdev, conductor, nanobanana, video-editing, multimodel) |\\n| **hooks** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Field Ordering Inconsistency\\n\\nThere is **no consistent field order** across plugins. Suggested standard order:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {},\\n  \\\"license\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"keywords\\\": [],\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {},\\n  \\\"npmDependencies\\\": {},\\n  \\\"compatibility\\\": {},\\n  \\\"agents\\\": [],\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [],\\n  \\\"skills\\\": [],\\n  \\\"outputStyles\\\": [],\\n  \\\"skillBundles\\\": {},\\n  \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n  \\\"envVars\\\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best Practices Violations\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent reference format**: Some plugins use directory names, others use file paths\\n2. **Mixed terminology**: \\\"keywords\\\" vs \\\"tags\\\" for the same purpose\\n3. **Missing category field**: Makes marketplace categorization inconsistent\\n4. **Missing license field**: Important for open source compliance\\n5. **No standard field order**: Makes manual review difficult\\n6. **Inconsistent author format**: String vs object\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Positive Patterns Observed\\n\\n1. ✅ **autopilot envVars schema**: Best practice for documenting environment variables\\n2. ✅ **multimodel skillBundles**: Good pattern for grouping related skills\\n3. ✅ **dev outputStyles**: Good pattern for customization\\n4. ✅ **Semantic versioning**: All plugins follow semver correctly\\n5. ✅ **File-based component references**: Most plugins use this (good for maintainability)\\n6. ✅ **Author object format**: More informative than string-only\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### High Priority (Breaking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Standardize agent references**: All plugins should use `[\\\"./agents/name.md\\\"]` format\\n   - Fix: agentdev agents field\\n\\n2. **Standardize command references**: All plugins should use `[\\\"./commands/name.md\\\"]` format\\n   - Fix: conductor commands field\\n\\n3. **Standardize keywords vs tags**: Choose one field name (recommend \\\"keywords\\\")\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Medium Priority (Consistency)\\n\\n4. **Standardize author format**: Use object format with name, email, company\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n5. **Add missing category field**: All plugins should have category\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n6. **Add missing license field**: All plugins should have explicit license\\n   - Fix: agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Low Priority (Nice to Have)\\n\\n7. **Standardize field ordering**: Apply consistent order across all plugins\\n\\n8. **Add homepage to all plugins**: Link to GitHub/documentation\\n\\n9. **Document environment variables**: Use autopilot's envVars pattern\\n\\n10. **Add compatibility field**: Document minimum Claude Code version\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Suggested Schema (Based on Analysis)\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"semver string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n

Linting**: Add pre-commit hook to validate plugin.json format\\n3. **Documentation**: Create PLUGIN_JSON_SCHEMA.md with official format specification\\n4. **Migration Guide**: Create migration guide for fixing agentdev and conductor formats\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Multiple plugins have critical format inconsistencies (agentdev agents, conductor commands, keywords vs tags) that must be standardized for Claude Code compatibility and maintainability.\\nKEY_ISSUES: agentdev agents format (strings vs files), conductor commands format (strings vs files),

However, there are **significant inconsistencies** in structure, field naming, and formatting across plugins. These inconsistencies indicate lack of a unified schema standard and will create maintenance challenges as the plugin ecosystem scales.\\n\\n**Key Issues Identified**:\\n1. **Inconsistent field naming**: `tags` vs `keywords`\\n2. **Inconsistent field ordering**: Author block placement varies\\n3. **Mixed path formats**: Agent/command/skill paths use different conventions\\n4. **Hooks definition inconsistency**: JSON object vs string path\\n5. **Missing optional fields**: Homepage, compatibility not uniformly applied\\n6. **Dependencies format variations**: String versions vs semantic versioning\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Schema Compliance ✅\\n\\nAll 12 files contain required core fields:\\n- ✅ `name` (present in all)\\n- ✅ `version` (present in all, semver format)\\n- ✅ `description` (present in all)\\n\\n### 2. Field Naming Inconsistencies ⚠️\\n\\n**Issue**: Two different fields for the same purpose.\\n\\n| Plugin | Uses `keywords` | Uses `tags` |\\n|--------|----------------|-------------|\\n| instantly | ✅ | |\\n| frontend | ✅ | |\\n| bun | ✅ | |\\n| code-analysis | ✅ | |\\n| agentdev | | ✅ |\\n| seo | ✅ | |\\n| conductor | | ✅ |\\n| nanobanana | ✅ | |\\n| video-editing | ✅ | |\\n| autopilot | ✅ | |\\n| dev | ✅ | |\\n| multimodel | | ✅ |\\n\\n**Impact**: Claude Code plugin system may treat these as different fields. Tools that parse metadata will need to check both fields. Search/discovery features may miss plugins using the wrong field.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on ONE field name. Based on npm/package.json conventions, `keywords` is more standard.\\n\\n### 3. Author Field Format Variations\\n\\n**Consistent format** (10/12 plugins use this):\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Simplified format** (2/12 plugins):\\n- `agentdev`: `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n- `conductor`: `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on object format for better metadata extraction.\\n\\n### 4. Field Ordering Inconsistencies\\n\\nNo consistent ordering across plugins. Examples:\\n\\n**instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → ...\\n```\\n\\n**agentdev, conductor, multimodel**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → homepage → tags → ...\\n```\\n\\n**autopilot**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → agents → commands → skills → hooks → dependencies → npmDependencies → compatibility → envVars\\n```\\n\\n**Impact**: Reduces readability, makes diffs harder to review, complicates automated tooling.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Define standard field order (suggest: metadata → paths → dependencies → config).\\n\\n### 5. Agent/Command/Skill Path Formats\\n\\n**Two conventions observed**:\\n\\n**Array of relative paths with extensions**:\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  \\\"./agents/developer.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./agents/architect.md\\\"\\n]\\n```\\nUsed by: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n\\n**Array of bare names**:\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  \\\"architect\\\",\\n  \\\"developer\\\"\\n]\\n```\\nUsed by: agentdev, conductor\\n\\n**Inconsistent skill paths**:\\n- Most use: `\\\"./skills/skill-name\\\"`\\n- Some use: `\\\"./skills/skill-name.md\\\"`\\n- Some use bare names\\n\\n**Impact**: Path resolution logic must handle multiple formats. Unclear which format is officially supported.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Document official format. Based on majority usage, prefer `./agents/name.md` with explicit extension.\\n\\n### 6. Hooks Configuration Formats\\n\\n**String path to JSON config** (8 plugins):\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Inline object** (1 plugin - agentdev):\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": {\\n  \\\"PreToolUse\\\": {\\n    \\\"handler\\\": \\\"hooks/debug-capture.ts\\\",\\n    \\\"entry\\\": \\\"handlePreToolUse\\\",\\n    \\\"enabled\\\": true,\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Impact**: Two different schemas for same field. Parsers must handle both.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Support both but document preferred format. Inline format is more transparent but external file is better for complex configs.\\n\\n### 7. Optional Field Usage\\n\\n| Field | Usage Count | Notes |\\n|-------|-------------|-------|\\n| `homepage` | 3/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| `compatibility` | 5/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, autopilot, dev, multimodel |\\n| `category` | 9/12 | Missing in agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| `dependencies` | 7/12 | |\\n| `npmDependencies` | 1/12 | Only autopilot |\\n| `envVars` | 1/12 | Only autopilot (excellent!) |\\n| `skillBundles` | 1/12 | Only multimodel |\\n\\n**Impact**: Inconsistent metadata affects discoverability and documentation generation.\\n\\n**Recommendation**:\\n- Add `homepage` to all (use repo URL)\\n- Add `compatibility` to all (even if just `\\\">=0.1.0\\\"`)\\n- Standardize `category` usage\\n\\n### 8. Version Format Consistency ✅\\n\\nAll plugins use semantic versioning correctly: `X.Y.Z`\\n\\n### 9. Description Quality Variations\\n\\n**Best practice** (detailed, includes version notes):\\n- `dev`: \\\"...v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation...\\\"\\n- `frontend`: \\\"...Features code-analysis integration via claudemem semantic search...\\\"\\n- `code-analysis`: \\\"...v3.0.0: ENRICHMENT MODE - hooks now enhance native tools...\\\"\\n\\n**Good** (clear feature list):\\n- `instantly`, `seo`, `autopilot`, `video-editing`, `bun`\\n\\n**Minimal** (brief, no version context):\\n- `nanobanana`, `conductor`\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Include version highlights in description for recent major changes.\\n\\n### 10. Dependency Specification\\n\\n**Version range format**:\\n- `\\\"orchestration@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^0.8.0\\\"` ✅ (semver range)\\n- `\\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"` ✅\\n\\n**Empty dependency objects**:\\n- `conductor`: `\\\"dependencies\\\": []` (array instead of object) ⚠️\\n- `multimodel`: `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}` (empty object) ✅\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Use empty object `{}` not empty array `[]` for no dependencies.\\n\\n### 11. Unique Features Worth Noting\\n\\n**Autopilot plugin** has excellent practices:\\n- ✅ Detailed `envVars` schema with descriptions, examples, defaults\\n- ✅ `npmDependencies` separate from plugin dependencies\\n- ✅ Comprehensive metadata\\n\\n**Multimodel plugin**:\\n- ✅ `skillBundles` for grouping related skills - innovative pattern\\n\\n**Agentdev plugin**:\\n- ✅ Inline hooks with detailed configuration - good for transparency\\n\\n### 12. Missing Best Practices\\n\\n**No plugin includes**:\\n- Minimum Node.js version requirement\\n- System dependency declarations (Chrome, FFmpeg, etc.)\\n- Explicit MCP server requirements\\n- Installation script references\\n- Documentation links within manifest\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Extend schema to include:\\n```json\\n\\\"systemRequirements\\\": {\\n  \\\"node\\\": \\\">=18.0.0\\\",\\n  \\\"system\\\": [\\\"chrome\\\", \\\"ffmpeg\\\"]\\n},\\n\\\"documentation\\\": {\\n  \\\"readme\\\": \\\"./README.md\\\",\\n  \\\"examples\\\": \\\"./examples/\\\",\\n  \\\"changelog\\\": \\\"./CHANGELOG.md\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### Issue 1: `tags` vs `keywords` Confusion\\n**Severity**: HIGH\\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor, multimodel use `tags`; others use `keywords`\\n**Fix**: Standardize to `keywords` (npm convention)\\n\\n### Issue 2: Conductor Empty Dependencies Array\\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\\n**File**: plugins/conductor/plugin.json line 30\\n**Current**: `\\\"dependencies\\\": []`\\n**Expected**: `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}`\\n**Impact**: Type mismatch - dependencies should be object not array\\n\\n### Issue 3: Inconsistent Path Formats\\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor use bare names; others use relative paths\\n**Fix**: Document official format or support both in plugin loader\\n\\n### Issue 4: Missing Compatibility Field\\n**Severity**: LOW\\n**Affected**: 7/12 plugins lack `compatibility.claudeCode` field\\n**Fix**: Add to all plugins for version tracking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. ✅ All files are valid JSON\\n2. ✅ All have required fields (name, version, description)\\n3. ✅ Semantic versioning consistently applied\\n4. ✅ Most plugins have comprehensive metadata\\n5. ✅ Author information consistently structured (10/12)\\n6. ✅ Category field used appropriately where present\\n7. ✅ Autopilot sets excellent example with `envVars` schema\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions (Breaking Issues)\\n1. **Fix conductor plugin**: Change `\\\"dependencies\\\": []` to `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}`\\n2. **Standardize keywords**: Rename `tags` → `keywords` in agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Short-term Actions (Consistency)\\n3. Define and document official plugin.json schema\\n4. Standardize field ordering across all plugins\\n5. Add missing `homepage` and `compatibility` fields\\n6. Standardize agent/command/skill path formats\\n7. Add `category` to agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Long-term Actions (Enhancement)\\n8. Extend schema with `systemRequirements` and `documentation` sections\\n9. Create validation tool that enforces schema\\n10. Add JSON schema file for IDE autocomplete\\n11. Consider adopting autopilot's `envVars` pattern for all plugins needing env config\\n12. Create plugin manifest generator/updater tool\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Schema Recommendation\\n\\nBased on analysis, here's the recommended unified schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"semver (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"string (optional)\\\",\\n    \\\"company\\\": \\\"string (optional)\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"license\\\": \\\"string (required, default: MIT)\\\",\\n  \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"url (optional)\\\",\\n  \\\"keywords\\\": [\\\"string\\\"] (recommended, not tags),\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"string (recommended)\\\",\\n  \\\"agents\\\": [\\\"./agents/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\\"./commands/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"skills\\\": [\\\"./skills/name\\\"],\\n  \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json | object\\\",\\n  \\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json | ./.mcp.json\\\",\\n  \\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\\"./output-styles/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"plugin@marketplace\\\": \\\"^version\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"npmDependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"package\\\": \\\"^version\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n    \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"systemRequirements\\\": {\\n    \\\"node\\\": \\\">=18.0.0\\\",\\n    \\\"system\\\": [\\\"binary-name\\\"]\\n  },\\n  \\\"envVars\\\": {\\n    \\\"VAR_NAME\\\": {\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n      \\\"required\\\": true|false,\\n      \\\"example\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n      \\\"default\\\": \\\"string\\\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n    \\\"bundle-name\\\": [\\\"skill1\\\", \\\"skill2\\\"]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Testing Recommendations\\n\\n1. Create JSON schema validator\\n2. Run schema validation in CI/CD\\n3. Create plugin.json linter\\n4. Add pre-commit hook for manifest validation\\n5. Generate documentation from manifests automatically\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Significant inconsistencies (tags vs keywords, dependency array vs object, path format variations) require standardization before scaling the plugin ecosystem.\\nKEY_ISSUES: tags/keywords inconsistency, conductor dependencies type mismatch, inconsistent path formats, missing

However, there are **significant inconsistencies** in structure, field naming, and formatting across plugins. These inconsistencies indicate lack of a unified schema standard and will create maintenance challenges as the plugin ecosystem scales.\\n\\n**Key Issues Identified**:\\n1. **Inconsistent field naming**: `tags` vs `keywords`\\n2. **Inconsistent field ordering**: Author block placement varies\\n3. **Mixed path formats**: Agent/command/skill paths use different conventions\\n4. **Hooks definition inconsistency**: JSON object vs string path\\n5. **Missing optional fields**: Homepage, compatibility not uniformly applied\\n6. **Dependencies format variations**: String versions vs semantic versioning\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Schema Compliance ✅\\n\\nAll 12 files contain required core fields:\\n- ✅ `name` (present in all)\\n- ✅ `version` (present in all, semver format)\\n- ✅ `description` (present in all)\\n\\n### 2. Field Naming Inconsistencies ⚠️\\n\\n**Issue**: Two different fields for the same purpose.\\n\\n| Plugin | Uses `keywords` | Uses `tags` |\\n|--------|----------------|-------------|\\n| instantly | ✅ | |\\n| frontend | ✅ | |\\n| bun | ✅ | |\\n| code-analysis | ✅ | |\\n| agentdev | | ✅ |\\n| seo | ✅ | |\\n| conductor | | ✅ |\\n| nanobanana | ✅ | |\\n| video-editing | ✅ | |\\n| autopilot | ✅ | |\\n| dev | ✅ | |\\n| multimodel | | ✅ |\\n\\n**Impact**: Claude Code plugin system may treat these as different fields. Tools that parse metadata will need to check both fields. Search/discovery features may miss plugins using the wrong field.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on ONE field name. Based on npm/package.json conventions, `keywords` is more standard.\\n\\n### 3. Author Field Format Variations\\n\\n**Consistent format** (10/12 plugins use this):\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Simplified format** (2/12 plugins):\\n- `agentdev`: `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n- `conductor`: `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on object format for better metadata extraction.\\n\\n### 4. Field Ordering Inconsistencies\\n\\nNo consistent ordering across plugins. Examples:\\n\\n**instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → ...\\n```\\n\\n**agentdev, conductor, multimodel**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → homepage → tags → ...\\n```\\n\\n**autopilot**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → agents → commands → skills → hooks → dependencies → npmDependencies → compatibility → envVars\\n```\\n\\n**Impact**: Reduces readability, makes diffs harder to review, complicates automated tooling.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Define standard field order (suggest: metadata → paths → dependencies → config).\\n\\n### 5. Agent/Command/Skill Path Formats\\n\\n**Two conventions observed**:\\n\\n**Array of relative paths with extensions**:\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  \\\"./agents/developer.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./agents/architect.md\\\"\\n]\\n```\\nUsed by: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n\\n**Array of bare names**:\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  \\\"architect\\\",\\n  \\\"developer\\\"\\n]\\n```\\nUsed by: agentdev, conductor\\n\\n**Inconsistent skill paths**:\\n- Most use: `\\\"./skills/skill-name\\\"`\\n- Some use: `\\\"./skills/skill-name.md\\\"`\\n- Some use bare names\\n\\n**Impact**: Path resolution logic must handle multiple formats. Unclear which format is officially supported.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Document official format. Based on majority usage, prefer `./agents/name.md` with explicit extension.\\n\\n### 6. Hooks Configuration Formats\\n\\n**String path to JSON config** (8 plugins):\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Inline object** (1 plugin - agentdev):\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": {\\n  \\\"PreToolUse\\\": {\\n    \\\"handler\\\": \\\"hooks/debug-capture.ts\\\",\\n    \\\"entry\\\": \\\"handlePreToolUse\\\",\\n    \\\"enabled\\\": true,\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Impact**: Two different schemas for same field. Parsers must handle both.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Support both but document preferred format. Inline format is more transparent but external file is better for complex configs.\\n\\n### 7. Optional Field Usage\\n\\n| Field | Usage Count | Notes |\\n|-------|-------------|-------|\\n| `homepage` | 3/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| `compatibility` | 5/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, autopilot, dev, multimodel |\\n| `category` | 9/12 | Missing in agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| `dependencies` | 7/12 | |\\n| `npmDependencies` | 1/12 | Only autopilot |\\n| `envVars` | 1/12 | Only autopilot (excellent!) |\\n| `skillBundles` | 1/12 | Only multimodel |\\n\\n**Impact**: Inconsistent metadata affects discoverability and documentation generation.\\n\\n**Recommendation**:\\n- Add `homepage` to all (use repo URL)\\n- Add `compatibility` to all (even if just `\\\">=0.1.0\\\"`)\\n- Standardize `category` usage\\n\\n### 8. Version Format Consistency ✅\\n\\nAll plugins use semantic versioning correctly: `X.Y.Z`\\n\\n### 9. Description Quality Variations\\n\\n**Best practice** (detailed, includes version notes):\\n- `dev`: \\\"...v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation...\\\"\\n- `frontend`: \\\"...Features code-analysis integration via claudemem semantic search...\\\"\\n- `code-analysis`: \\\"...v3.0.0: ENRICHMENT MODE - hooks now enhance native tools...\\\"\\n\\n**Good** (clear feature list):\\n- `instantly`, `seo`, `autopilot`, `video-editing`, `bun`\\n\\n**Minimal** (brief, no version context):\\n- `nanobanana`, `conductor`\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Include version highlights in description for recent major changes.\\n\\n### 10. Dependency Specification\\n\\n**Version range format**:\\n- `\\\"orchestration@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^0.8.0\\\"` ✅ (semver range)\\n- `\\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"` ✅\\n\\n**Empty dependency objects**:\\n- `conductor`: `\\\"dependencies\\\": []` (array instead of object) ⚠️\\n- `multimodel`: `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}` (empty object) ✅\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Use empty object `{}` not empty array `[]` for no dependencies.\\n\\n### 11. Unique Features Worth Noting\\n\\n**Autopilot plugin** has excellent practices:\\n- ✅ Detailed `envVars` schema with descriptions, examples, defaults\\n- ✅ `npmDependencies` separate from plugin dependencies\\n- ✅ Comprehensive metadata\\n\\n**Multimodel plugin**:\\n- ✅ `skillBundles` for grouping related skills - innovative pattern\\n\\n**Agentdev plugin**:\\n- ✅ Inline hooks with detailed configuration - good for transparency\\n\\n### 12. Missing Best Practices\\n\\n**No plugin includes**:\\n- Minimum Node.js version requirement\\n- System dependency declarations (Chrome, FFmpeg, etc.)\\n- Explicit MCP server requirements\\n- Installation script references\\n- Documentation links within manifest\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Extend schema to include:\\n```json\\n\\\"systemRequirements\\\": {\\n  \\\"node\\\": \\\">=18.0.0\\\",\\n  \\\"system\\\": [\\\"chrome\\\", \\\"ffmpeg\\\"]\\n},\\n\\\"documentation\\\": {\\n  \\\"readme\\\": \\\"./README.md\\\",\\n  \\\"examples\\\": \\\"./examples/\\\",\\n  \\\"changelog\\\": \\\"./CHANGELOG.md\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### Issue 1: `tags` vs `keywords` Confusion\\n**Severity**: HIGH\\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor, multimodel use `tags`; others use `keywords`\\n**Fix**: Standardize to `keywords` (npm convention)\\n\\n### Issue 2: Conductor Empty Dependencies Array\\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\\n**File**: plugins/conductor/plugin.json line 30\\n**Current**: `\\\"dependencies\\\": []`\\n**Expected**: `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}`\\n**Impact**: Type mismatch - dependencies should be object not array\\n\\n### Issue 3: Inconsistent Path Formats\\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor use bare names; others use relative paths\\n**Fix**: Document official format or support both in plugin loader\\n\\n### Issue 4: Missing Compatibility Field\\n**Severity**: LOW\\n**Affected**: 7/12 plugins lack `compatibility.claudeCode` field\\n**Fix**: Add to all plugins for version tracking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. ✅ All files are valid JSON\\n2. ✅ All have required fields (name, version, description)\\n3. ✅ Semantic versioning consistently applied\\n4. ✅ Most plugins have comprehensive metadata\\n5. ✅ Author information consistently structured (10/12)\\n6. ✅ Category field used appropriately where present\\n7. ✅ Autopilot sets excellent example with `envVars` schema\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions (Breaking Issues)\\n1. **Fix conductor plugin**: Change `\\\"dependencies\\\": []` to `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}`\\n2. **Standardize keywords**: Rename `tags` → `keywords` in agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Short-term Actions (Consistency)\\n3. Define and document official plugin.json schema\\n4. Standardize field ordering across all plugins\\n5. Add missing `homepage` and `compatibility` fields\\n6. Standardize agent/command/skill path formats\\n7. Add `category` to agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Long-term Actions (Enhancement)\\n8. Extend schema with `systemRequirements` and `documentation` sections\\n9. Create validation tool that enforces schema\\n10. Add JSON schema file for IDE autocomplete\\n11. Consider adopting autopilot's `envVars` pattern for all plugins needing env config\\n12. Create plugin manifest generator/updater tool\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Schema Recommendation\\n\\nBased on analysis, here's the recommended unified schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"semver (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"string (optional)\\\",\\n    \\\"company\\\": \\\"string (optional)\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"license\\\": \\\"string (required, default: MIT)\\\",\\n  \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"url (optional)\\\",\\n  \\\"keywords\\\": [\\\"string\\\"] (recommended, not tags),\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"string (recommended)\\\",\\n  \\\"agents\\\": [\\\"./agents/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\\"./commands/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"skills\\\": [\\\"./skills/name\\\"],\\n  \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json | object\\\",\\n  \\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json | ./.mcp.json\\\",\\n  \\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\\"./output-styles/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"plugin@marketplace\\\": \\\"^version\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"npmDependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"package\\\": \\\"^version\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n    \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"systemRequirements\\\": {\\n    \\\"node\\\": \\\">=18.0.0\\\",\\n    \\\"system\\\": [\\\"binary-name\\\"]\\n  },\\n  \\\"envVars\\\": {\\n    \\\"VAR_NAME\\\": {\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n      \\\"required\\\": true|false,\\n      \\\"example\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n      \\\"default\\\": \\\"string\\\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n    \\\"bundle-name\\\": [\\\"skill1\\\", \\\"skill2\\\"]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Testing Recommendations\\n\\n1. Create JSON schema validator\\n2. Run schema validation in CI/CD\\n3. Create plugin.json linter\\n4. Add pre-commit hook for manifest validation\\n5. Generate documentation from manifests automatically\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Significant inconsistencies (tags vs keywords, dependency array vs object, path format variations) require standardization before scaling the plugin ecosystem.\\nKEY_ISSUES: tags/keywords inconsistency, conductor dependencies type mismatch, inconsistent path formats, missing compatibility fields, no unified schema documentation\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Appendix: File-by-File Summary\\n\\n| Plugin | Version | Issues | Strengths |\\n|--------|---------|--------|-----------|\\n| instantly | 1.0.1 | None major | Clean structure, good keywords |\\n| frontend | 3.14.0 | None major | Excellent description with version notes |\\n| bun | 1.6.0 | None major | Clean, comprehensive |\\n| code-analysis | 3.2.0 | None major | Good version notes in description |\\n| agentdev | 1.5.0 | Uses `tags` instead of `keywords`, simplified author | Excellent inline hooks, good docs links |\\n| seo | 1.6.0 | None major | Good autonomy description |\\n| conductor | 2.1.0 | Uses `tags`, dependencies is array not object | Clean structure |\\n| nanobanana | 2.3.0 | Brief description | Clean, minimal |\\n| video-editing | 1.1.0 | None major | Good keyword coverage |\\n| autopilot | 0.2.0 | None major | **Best practice example**: envVars schema, npmDependencies |\\n| dev | 1.29.0 | None major | Comprehensive, excellent version notes |\\n| multimodel | 2.2.0 | Uses `tags` | Innovative skillBundles pattern |\\n\\n**Quality Score**: 7.5/10\\n- Valid JSON: ✅\\n- Required fields: ✅\\n- Consistency: ⚠️ (major variations)\\n- Best practices: ⚠️ (some plugins excellent, others basic)\\n- Documentation: ⚠️ (no schema reference)\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":10656,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":18820,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":10656,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyfR1qmL4EW3He8EsdmY\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"3371861e-0186-4e76-8fe3-c4f31965131e\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:18:01.110Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"3371861e-0186-4e76-8fe3-c4f31965131e\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"2807edae-3175-4d0a-b959-b34dbbe8e890\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4ddef8\",\"slug\":\"compressed-splashing-flame\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MgvcNBJJNG2492Ub9vLvYH\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MgvcNBJJNG2492Ub9vLvYH\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:18:01.114Z\",\"uuid\":\"310bd9bf-bdfd-42fe-9cdb-f18357ef0743\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"310bd9bf-bdfd-42fe-9cdb-f18357ef0743\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"2807edae-3175-4d0a-b959-b34dbbe8e890\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4ddef8\",\"slug\":\"compressed-splashing-flame\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MgvcNBJJNG2492Ub9vLvYH\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MgvcNBJJNG2492Ub9vLvYH\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:18:01.114Z\",\"uuid\":\"e6cc69c4-8780-4d41-868a-04a885d71378\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"3371861e-0186-4e76-8fe3-c4f31965131e\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"2807edae-3175-4d0a-b959-b34dbbe8e890\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4ddef8\",\"slug\":\"compressed-splashing-flame\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MgvcNBJJNG2492Ub9vLvYH\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-plugin-json-q-20260210-141618-b78253d6/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"38dd79b2-54c1-4adf-8b56-e8e70ed53c89\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:18:01.114Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"3371861e-0186-4e76-8fe3-c4f31965131e\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nReview the code quality of all plugin.json files in this repository.

However, there are **significant inconsistencies** in structure, field naming, and formatting across plugins. These inconsistencies indicate lack of a unified schema standard and will create maintenance challenges as the plugin ecosystem scales.\\n\\n**Key Issues Identified**:\\n1. **Inconsistent field naming**: `tags` vs `keywords`\\n2. **Inconsistent field ordering**: Author block placement varies\\n3. **Mixed path formats**: Agent/command/skill paths use different conventions\\n4. **Hooks definition inconsistency**: JSON object vs string path\\n5. **Missing optional fields**: Homepage, compatibility not uniformly applied\\n6. **Dependencies format variations**: String versions vs semantic versioning\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Schema Compliance ✅\\n\\nAll 12 files contain required core fields:\\n- ✅ `name` (present in all)\\n- ✅ `version` (present in all, semver format)\\n- ✅ `description` (present in all)\\n\\n### 2. Field Naming Inconsistencies ⚠️\\n\\n**Issue**: Two different fields for the same purpose.\\n\\n| Plugin | Uses `keywords` | Uses `tags` |\\n|--------|----------------|-------------|\\n| instantly | ✅ | |\\n| frontend | ✅ | |\\n| bun | ✅ | |\\n| code-analysis | ✅ | |\\n| agentdev | | ✅ |\\n| seo | ✅ | |\\n| conductor | | ✅ |\\n| nanobanana | ✅ | |\\n| video-editing | ✅ | |\\n| autopilot | ✅ | |\\n| dev | ✅ | |\\n| multimodel | | ✅ |\\n\\n**Impact**: Claude Code plugin system may treat these as different fields. Tools that parse metadata will need to check both fields. Search/discovery features may miss plugins using the wrong field.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on ONE field name. Based on npm/package.json conventions, `keywords` is more standard.\\n\\n### 3. Author Field Format Variations\\n\\n**Consistent format** (10/12 plugins use this):\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Simplified format** (2/12 plugins):\\n- `agentdev`: `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n- `conductor`: `\\\"author\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"`\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on object format for better metadata extraction.\\n\\n### 4. Field Ordering Inconsistencies\\n\\nNo consistent ordering across plugins. Examples:\\n\\n**instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → ...\\n```\\n\\n**agentdev, conductor, multimodel**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → homepage → tags → ...\\n```\\n\\n**autopilot**:\\n```\\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → agents → commands → skills → hooks → dependencies → npmDependencies → compatibility → envVars\\n```\\n\\n**Impact**: Reduces readability, makes diffs harder to review, complicates automated tooling.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Define standard field order (suggest: metadata → paths → dependencies → config).\\n\\n### 5. Agent/Command/Skill Path Formats\\n\\n**Two conventions observed**:\\n\\n**Array of relative paths with extensions**:\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  \\\"./agents/developer.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./agents/architect.md\\\"\\n]\\n```\\nUsed by: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\\n\\n**Array of bare names**:\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  \\\"architect\\\",\\n  \\\"developer\\\"\\n]\\n```\\nUsed by: agentdev, conductor\\n\\n**Inconsistent skill paths**:\\n- Most use: `\\\"./skills/skill-name\\\"`\\n- Some use: `\\\"./skills/skill-name.md\\\"`\\n- Some use bare names\\n\\n**Impact**: Path resolution logic must handle multiple formats. Unclear which format is officially supported.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Document official format. Based on majority usage, prefer `./agents/name.md` with explicit extension.\\n\\n### 6. Hooks Configuration Formats\\n\\n**String path to JSON config** (8 plugins):\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Inline object** (1 plugin - agentdev):\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": {\\n  \\\"PreToolUse\\\": {\\n    \\\"handler\\\": \\\"hooks/debug-capture.ts\\\",\\n    \\\"entry\\\": \\\"handlePreToolUse\\\",\\n    \\\"enabled\\\": true,\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Impact**: Two different schemas for same field. Parsers must handle both.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Support both but document preferred format. Inline format is more transparent but external file is better for complex configs.\\n\\n### 7. Optional Field Usage\\n\\n| Field | Usage Count | Notes |\\n|-------|-------------|-------|\\n| `homepage` | 3/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| `compatibility` | 5/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, autopilot, dev, multimodel |\\n| `category` | 9/12 | Missing in agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\\n| `dependencies` | 7/12 | |\\n| `npmDependencies` | 1/12 | Only autopilot |\\n| `envVars` | 1/12 | Only autopilot (excellent!) |\\n| `skillBundles` | 1/12 | Only multimodel |\\n\\n**Impact**: Inconsistent metadata affects discoverability and documentation generation.\\n\\n**Recommendation**:\\n- Add `homepage` to all (use repo URL)\\n- Add `compatibility` to all (even if just `\\\">=0.1.0\\\"`)\\n- Standardize `category` usage\\n\\n### 8. Version Format Consistency ✅\\n\\nAll plugins use semantic versioning correctly: `X.Y.Z`\\n\\n### 9. Description Quality Variations\\n\\n**Best practice** (detailed, includes version notes):\\n- `dev`: \\\"...v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation...\\\"\\n- `frontend`: \\\"...Features code-analysis integration via claudemem semantic search...\\\"\\n- `code-analysis`: \\\"...v3.0.0: ENRICHMENT MODE - hooks now enhance native tools...\\\"\\n\\n**Good** (clear feature list):\\n- `instantly`, `seo`, `autopilot`, `video-editing`, `bun`\\n\\n**Minimal** (brief, no version context):\\n- `nanobanana`, `conductor`\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Include version highlights in description for recent major changes.\\n\\n### 10. Dependency Specification\\n\\n**Version range format**:\\n- `\\\"orchestration@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^0.8.0\\\"` ✅ (semver range)\\n- `\\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"` ✅\\n\\n**Empty dependency objects**:\\n- `conductor`: `\\\"dependencies\\\": []` (array instead of object) ⚠️\\n- `multimodel`: `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}` (empty object) ✅\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Use empty object `{}` not empty array `[]` for no dependencies.\\n\\n### 11. Unique Features Worth Noting\\n\\n**Autopilot plugin** has excellent practices:\\n- ✅ Detailed `envVars` schema with descriptions, examples, defaults\\n- ✅ `npmDependencies` separate from plugin dependencies\\n- ✅ Comprehensive metadata\\n\\n**Multimodel plugin**:\\n- ✅ `skillBundles` for grouping related skills - innovative pattern\\n\\n**Agentdev plugin**:\\n- ✅ Inline hooks with detailed configuration - good for transparency\\n\\n### 12. Missing Best Practices\\n\\n**No plugin includes**:\\n- Minimum Node.js version requirement\\n- System dependency declarations (Chrome, FFmpeg, etc.)\\n- Explicit MCP server requirements\\n- Installation script references\\n- Documentation links within manifest\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Extend schema to include:\\n```json\\n\\\"systemRequirements\\\": {\\n  \\\"node\\\": \\\">=18.0.0\\\",\\n  \\\"system\\\": [\\\"chrome\\\", \\\"ffmpeg\\\"]\\n},\\n\\\"documentation\\\": {\\n  \\\"readme\\\": \\\"./README.md\\\",\\n  \\\"examples\\\": \\\"./examples/\\\",\\n  \\\"changelog\\\": \\\"./CHANGELOG.md\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### Issue 1: `tags` vs `keywords` Confusion\\n**Severity**: HIGH\\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor, multimodel use `tags`; others use `keywords`\\n**Fix**: Standardize to `keywords` (npm convention)\\n\\n### Issue 2: Conductor Empty Dependencies Array\\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\\n**File**: plugins/conductor/plugin.json line 30\\n**Current**: `\\\"dependencies\\\": []`\\n**Expected**: `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}`\\n**Impact**: Type mismatch - dependencies should be object not array\\n\\n### Issue 3: Inconsistent Path Formats\\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor use bare names; others use relative paths\\n**Fix**: Document official format or support both in plugin loader\\n\\n### Issue 4: Missing Compatibility Field\\n**Severity**: LOW\\n**Affected**: 7/12 plugins lack `compatibility.claudeCode` field\\n**Fix**: Add to all plugins for version tracking\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. ✅ All files are valid JSON\\n2. ✅ All have required fields (name, version, description)\\n3. ✅ Semantic versioning consistently applied\\n4. ✅ Most plugins have comprehensive metadata\\n5. ✅ Author information consistently structured (10/12)\\n6. ✅ Category field used appropriately where present\\n7. ✅ Autopilot sets excellent example with `envVars` schema\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions (Breaking Issues)\\n1. **Fix conductor plugin**: Change `\\\"dependencies\\\": []` to `\\\"dependencies\\\": {}`\\n2. **Standardize keywords**: Rename `tags` → `keywords` in agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Short-term Actions (Consistency)\\n3. Define and document official plugin.json schema\\n4. Standardize field ordering across all plugins\\n5. Add missing `homepage` and `compatibility` fields\\n6. Standardize agent/command/skill path formats\\n7. Add `category` to agentdev, conductor, multimodel\\n\\n### Long-term Actions (Enhancement)\\n8. Extend schema with `systemRequirements` and `documentation` sections\\n9. Create validation tool that enforces schema\\n10. Add JSON schema file for IDE autocomplete\\n11. Consider adopting autopilot's `envVars` pattern for all plugins needing env config\\n12. Create plugin manifest generator/updater tool\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Schema Recommendation\\n\\nBased on analysis, here's the recommended unified schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"version\\\": \\\"semver (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"description\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n  \\\"author\\\": {\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"string (required)\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"string (optional)\\\",\\n    \\\"company\\\": \\\"string (optional)\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"license\\\": \\\"string (required, default: MIT)\\\",\\n  \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"url (optional)\\\",\\n  \\\"keywords\\\": [\\\"string\\\"] (recommended, not tags),\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"string (recommended)\\\",\\n  \\\"agents\\\": [\\\"./agents/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\\"./commands/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"skills\\\": [\\\"./skills/name\\\"],\\n  \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json | object\\\",\\n  \\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json | ./.mcp.json\\\",\\n  \\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\\"./output-styles/name.md\\\"],\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"plugin@marketplace\\\": \\\"^version\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"npmDependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"package\\\": \\\"^version\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n    \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"systemRequirements\\\": {\\n    \\\"node\\\": \\\">=18.0.0\\\",\\n    \\\"system\\\": [\\\"binary-name\\\"]\\n  },\\n  \\\"envVars\\\": {\\n    \\\"VAR_NAME\\\": {\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n      \\\"required\\\": true|false,\\n      \\\"example\\\": \\\"string\\\",\\n      \\\"default\\\": \\\"string\\\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n    \\\"bundle-name\\\": [\\\"skill1\\\", \\\"skill2\\\"]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Testing Recommendations\\n\\n1.

Overall, the plugin manifests demonstrate **good quality** with consistent patterns, but there are **significant inconsistencies** in field usage, format, and required fields that need standardization.\n\n**Key Findings**:\n- ✅ All files are valid JSON with no syntax errors\n- ✅ All required fields (name, version, description) present\n- ✅ Version format is consistent (semantic versioning)\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent agent reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\n- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Inconsistent command reference format (array of strings vs array of filenames)\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field presence (author, license, homepage, tags vs keywords)\n- ⚠️ Inconsistent field ordering across plugins\n- ⚠️ Mixed use of \"tags\" vs \"keywords\" fields\n- ⚠️ Some plugins use inline hooks objects, others use file references\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis by Plugin\n\n### 1. **instantly** (v1.0.1)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference\n- Consistent with: frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\n\n### 2. **frontend** (v3.14.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\n- Consistent with: instantly, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\n\n### 3. **bun** (v1.6.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\n\n### 4. **code-analysis** (v3.2.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference (.mcp.json)\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, seo, nanobanana, video-editing\n\n### 5. **agentdev** (v1.5.0)\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\n- **CRITICAL**: agents field is array of strings (directory names only): `[\"architect\", \"developer\", \"reviewer\"]`\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field uses file references: `[\"./commands/develop.md\", ...]`\n- **Mixed format within same file** - agents don't match commands\n- Uses: \"tags\" instead of \"keywords\"\n- Uses: \"author\" as string instead of object\n- Uses: inline hooks object instead of file reference\n- Has: dependencies, compatibility\n- **Different from all other plugins**\n\n### 6. **seo** (v1.6.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: hooks file reference, mcpServers file reference, dependencies\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, nanobanana, video-editing\n\n### 7. **conductor** (v2.1.0)\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\n- **CRITICAL**: commands field is array of strings (names only): `[\"setup\", \"new-track\", ...]`\n- Uses: \"tags\" instead of \"keywords\"\n- Uses: \"author\" as string instead of object\n- Has: empty skills array, empty dependencies array, compatibility\n- **Different from most plugins**\n\n### 8. **nanobanana** (v2.3.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, video-editing\n\n### 9. **video-editing** (v1.1.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- **Missing**: hooks, mcpServers (not required, so acceptable)\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana\n\n### 10. **autopilot** (v0.2.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Very Good (most comprehensive)\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: hooks file reference, dependencies\n- **Extra fields** (good additions): npmDependencies, compatibility, envVars (with detailed schema)\n- Most complete schema of all plugins\n\n### 11. **dev** (v1.29.0)\n**Status**: ✅ Good\n- Standard format: file-based agent/command references\n- Has: name, version, description, author (object), license, keywords, category\n- Uses: mcpServers file reference, dependencies, compatibility\n- **Extra field**: outputStyles (unique to this plugin)\n- Consistent with: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo\n\n### 12. **multimodel** (v2.2.0)\n**Status**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT FORMAT**\n- Uses: \"tags\" instead of \"keywords\"\n- Uses: \"author\" as string instead of object\n- Uses: hooks file reference\n- Has: dependencies (empty object), compatibility\n- **Extra field**: skillBundles (good pattern for grouping)\n- **Missing**: commands field uses standard file-based references (good)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues\n\n### 1. **Agent Reference Format Inconsistency**\n\n**File-based references (10 plugins)**: `[\"./agents/developer.md\", \"./agents/architect.md\"]`\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel (no agents)\n\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\"architect\", \"developer\", \"reviewer\"]`\n- ❌ agentdev\n\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads agents\n\n### 2. **Command Reference Format Inconsistency**\n\n**File-based references (11 plugins)**: `[\"./commands/help.md\", \"./commands/setup.md\"]`\n- ✅ instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, agentdev, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev, multimodel\n\n**String-only references (1 plugin)**: `[\"setup\", \"new-track\", \"implement\"]`\n- ❌ conductor\n\n**Impact**: High - affects how Claude Code loads commands\n\n### 3. **Keywords vs Tags Field**\n\n**Uses \"keywords\"** (7 plugins): instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\n**Uses \"tags\"** (3 plugins): agentdev, conductor, multimodel\n\n**Impact**: Medium - affects searchability and categorization\n\n### 4. **Author Field Format**\n\n**Author as object** (9 plugins):\n```json\n\"author\": {\n  \"name\": \"Jack Rudenko\",\n  \"email\": \"i@madappgang.com\",\n  \"company\": \"MadAppGang\"\n}\n```\n- instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\n\n**Author as string** (3 plugins): `\"author\": \"MadAppGang\"`\n- agentdev, conductor, multimodel\n\n**Impact**: Low - both valid, but object format is more informative\n\n### 5. **Hooks Field Format**\n\n**Hooks as file reference** (6 plugins): `\"hooks\": \"./hooks/hooks.json\"`\n- instantly, code-analysis, seo, autopilot, multimodel\n\n**Hooks as inline object** (1 plugin): Full hook configuration inline\n- agentdev\n\n**No hooks** (5 plugins): frontend, bun, nanobanana, video-editing, conductor, dev\n\n**Impact**: Low - both valid patterns, but file reference is cleaner\n\n---\n\n## Missing Fields Analysis\n\n### Optional but Recommended Fields\n\n| Field | Present In | Missing From |\n|-------|-----------|--------------|\n| **category** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\n| **license** | 9 plugins | agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\n| **homepage** | 3 plugins | 9 plugins (instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, dev, autopilot) |\n| **dependencies** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\n| **compatibility** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\n| **mcpServers** | 7 plugins | 5 plugins (agentdev, conductor, nanobanana, video-editing, multimodel) |\n| **hooks** | 5 plugins | 7 plugins |\n\n---\n\n## Field Ordering Inconsistency\n\nThere is **no consistent field order** across plugins.

However, there are **significant inconsistencies** in structure, field naming, and formatting across plugins. These inconsistencies indicate lack of a unified schema standard and will create maintenance challenges as the plugin ecosystem scales.\n\n**Key Issues Identified**:\n1. **Inconsistent field naming**: `tags` vs `keywords`\n2. **Inconsistent field ordering**: Author block placement varies\n3. **Mixed path formats**: Agent/command/skill paths use different conventions\n4. **Hooks definition inconsistency**: JSON object vs string path\n5. **Missing optional fields**: Homepage, compatibility not uniformly applied\n6. **Dependencies format variations**: String versions vs semantic versioning\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis\n\n### 1. Schema Compliance ✅\n\nAll 12 files contain required core fields:\n- ✅ `name` (present in all)\n- ✅ `version` (present in all, semver format)\n- ✅ `description` (present in all)\n\n### 2. Field Naming Inconsistencies ⚠️\n\n**Issue**: Two different fields for the same purpose.\n\n| Plugin | Uses `keywords` | Uses `tags` |\n|--------|----------------|-------------|\n| instantly | ✅ | |\n| frontend | ✅ | |\n| bun | ✅ | |\n| code-analysis | ✅ | |\n| agentdev | | ✅ |\n| seo | ✅ | |\n| conductor | | ✅ |\n| nanobanana | ✅ | |\n| video-editing | ✅ | |\n| autopilot | ✅ | |\n| dev | ✅ | |\n| multimodel | | ✅ |\n\n**Impact**: Claude Code plugin system may treat these as different fields. Tools that parse metadata will need to check both fields. Search/discovery features may miss plugins using the wrong field.\n\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on ONE field name. Based on npm/package.json conventions, `keywords` is more standard.\n\n### 3. Author Field Format Variations\n\n**Consistent format** (10/12 plugins use this):\n```json\n\"author\": {\n  \"name\": \"Jack Rudenko\",\n  \"email\": \"i@madappgang.com\",\n  \"company\": \"MadAppGang\"\n}\n```\n\n**Simplified format** (2/12 plugins):\n- `agentdev`: `\"author\": \"MadAppGang\"`\n- `conductor`: `\"author\": \"MadAppGang\"`\n\n**Recommendation**: Standardize on object format for better metadata extraction.\n\n### 4. Field Ordering Inconsistencies\n\nNo consistent ordering across plugins. Examples:\n\n**instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing**:\n```\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → ...\n```\n\n**agentdev, conductor, multimodel**:\n```\nname → version → description → author → license → homepage → tags → ...\n```\n\n**autopilot**:\n```\nname → version → description → author → license → keywords → category → agents → commands → skills → hooks → dependencies → npmDependencies → compatibility → envVars\n```\n\n**Impact**: Reduces readability, makes diffs harder to review, complicates automated tooling.\n\n**Recommendation**: Define standard field order (suggest: metadata → paths → dependencies → config).\n\n### 5. Agent/Command/Skill Path Formats\n\n**Two conventions observed**:\n\n**Array of relative paths with extensions**:\n```json\n\"agents\": [\n  \"./agents/developer.md\",\n  \"./agents/architect.md\"\n]\n```\nUsed by: instantly, frontend, bun, code-analysis, seo, nanobanana, video-editing, autopilot, dev\n\n**Array of bare names**:\n```json\n\"agents\": [\n  \"architect\",\n  \"developer\"\n]\n```\nUsed by: agentdev, conductor\n\n**Inconsistent skill paths**:\n- Most use: `\"./skills/skill-name\"`\n- Some use: `\"./skills/skill-name.md\"`\n- Some use bare names\n\n**Impact**: Path resolution logic must handle multiple formats. Unclear which format is officially supported.\n\n**Recommendation**: Document official format. Based on majority usage, prefer `./agents/name.md` with explicit extension.\n\n### 6. Hooks Configuration Formats\n\n**String path to JSON config** (8 plugins):\n```json\n\"hooks\": \"./hooks/hooks.json\"\n```\n\n**Inline object** (1 plugin - agentdev):\n```json\n\"hooks\": {\n  \"PreToolUse\": {\n    \"handler\": \"hooks/debug-capture.ts\",\n    \"entry\": \"handlePreToolUse\",\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"description\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Impact**: Two different schemas for same field. Parsers must handle both.\n\n**Recommendation**: Support both but document preferred format. Inline format is more transparent but external file is better for complex configs.\n\n### 7. Optional Field Usage\n\n| Field | Usage Count | Notes |\n|-------|-------------|-------|\n| `homepage` | 3/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\n| `compatibility` | 5/12 | Only agentdev, conductor, autopilot, dev, multimodel |\n| `category` | 9/12 | Missing in agentdev, conductor, multimodel |\n| `dependencies` | 7/12 | |\n| `npmDependencies` | 1/12 | Only autopilot |\n| `envVars` | 1/12 | Only autopilot (excellent!) |\n| `skillBundles` | 1/12 | Only multimodel |\n\n**Impact**: Inconsistent metadata affects discoverability and documentation generation.\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- Add `homepage` to all (use repo URL)\n- Add `compatibility` to all (even if just `\">=0.1.0\"`)\n- Standardize `category` usage\n\n### 8. Version Format Consistency ✅\n\nAll plugins use semantic versioning correctly: `X.Y.Z`\n\n### 9. Description Quality Variations\n\n**Best practice** (detailed, includes version notes):\n- `dev`: \"...v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation...\"\n- `frontend`: \"...Features code-analysis integration via claudemem semantic search...\"\n- `code-analysis`: \"...v3.0.0: ENRICHMENT MODE - hooks now enhance native tools...\"\n\n**Good** (clear feature list):\n- `instantly`, `seo`, `autopilot`, `video-editing`, `bun`\n\n**Minimal** (brief, no version context):\n- `nanobanana`, `conductor`\n\n**Recommendation**: Include version highlights in description for recent major changes.\n\n### 10. Dependency Specification\n\n**Version range format**:\n- `\"orchestration@mag-claude-plugins\": \"^0.8.0\"` ✅ (semver range)\n- `\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\": \"^2.0.0\"` ✅\n\n**Empty dependency objects**:\n- `conductor`: `\"dependencies\": []` (array instead of object) ⚠️\n- `multimodel`: `\"dependencies\": {}` (empty object) ✅\n\n**Recommendation**: Use empty object `{}` not empty array `[]` for no dependencies.\n\n### 11. Unique Features Worth Noting\n\n**Autopilot plugin** has excellent practices:\n- ✅ Detailed `envVars` schema with descriptions, examples, defaults\n- ✅ `npmDependencies` separate from plugin dependencies\n- ✅ Comprehensive metadata\n\n**Multimodel plugin**:\n- ✅ `skillBundles` for grouping related skills - innovative pattern\n\n**Agentdev plugin**:\n- ✅ Inline hooks with detailed configuration - good for transparency\n\n### 12. Missing Best Practices\n\n**No plugin includes**:\n- Minimum Node.js version requirement\n- System dependency declarations (Chrome, FFmpeg, etc.)\n- Explicit MCP server requirements\n- Installation script references\n- Documentation links within manifest\n\n**Recommendation**: Extend schema to include:\n```json\n\"systemRequirements\": {\n  \"node\": \">=18.0.0\",\n  \"system\": [\"chrome\", \"ffmpeg\"]\n},\n\"documentation\": {\n  \"readme\": \"./README.md\",\n  \"examples\": \"./examples/\",\n  \"changelog\": \"./CHANGELOG.md\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues\n\n### Issue 1: `tags` vs `keywords` Confusion\n**Severity**: HIGH\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor, multimodel use `tags`; others use `keywords`\n**Fix**: Standardize to `keywords` (npm convention)\n\n### Issue 2: Conductor Empty Dependencies Array\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\n**File**: plugins/conductor/plugin.json line 30\n**Current**: `\"dependencies\": []`\n**Expected**: `\"dependencies\": {}`\n**Impact**: Type mismatch - dependencies should be object not array\n\n### Issue 3: Inconsistent Path Formats\n**Severity**: MEDIUM\n**Affected**: agentdev, conductor use bare names; others use relative paths\n**Fix**: Document official format or support both in plugin loader\n\n### Issue 4: Missing Compatibility Field\n**Severity**: LOW\n**Affected**: 7/12 plugins lack `compatibility.claudeCode` field\n**Fix**: Add to all plugins for version tracking\n\n---\n\n## Strengths\n\n1. ✅ All files are valid JSON\n2. ✅ All have required fields (name, version, description)\n3. ✅ Semantic versioning consistently applied\n4. ✅ Most plugins have comprehensive metadata\n5. ✅ Author information consistently structured (10/12)\n6. ✅ Category field used appropriately where present\n7. ✅ Autopilot sets excellent example with `envVars` schema\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (Breaking Issues)\n1. **Fix conductor plugin**: Change `\"dependencies\": []` to `\"dependencies\": {}`\n2. **Standardize keywords**: Rename `tags` → `keywords` in agentdev, conductor, multimodel\n\n### Short-term Actions (Consistency)\n3. Define and document official plugin.json schema\n4. Standardize field ordering across all plugins\n5. Add missing `homepage` and `compatibility` fields\n6. Standardize agent/command/skill path formats\n7. Add `category` to agentdev, conductor, multimodel\n\n### Long-term Actions (Enhancement)\n8.

Consider adopting autopilot's `envVars` pattern for all plugins needing env config\n12. Create plugin manifest generator/updater tool\n\n---\n\n## Schema Recommendation\n\nBased on analysis, here's the recommended unified schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"string (required)\",\n  \"version\": \"semver (required)\",\n  \"description\": \"string (required)\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"name\": \"string (required)\",\n    \"email\": \"string (optional)\",\n    \"company\": \"string (optional)\"\n  },\n  \"license\": \"string (required, default: MIT)\",\n  \"homepage\": \"url (optional)\",\n  \"keywords\": [\"string\"] (recommended, not tags),\n  \"category\": \"string (recommended)\",\n  \"agents\": [\"./agents/name.md\"],\n  \"commands\": [\"./commands/name.md\"],\n  \"skills\": [\"./skills/name\"],\n  \"hooks\": \"./hooks/hooks.json | object\",\n  \"mcpServers\": \"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json | ./.mcp.json\",\n  \"outputStyles\": [\"./output-styles/name.md\"],\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"plugin@marketplace\": \"^version\"\n  },\n  \"npmDependencies\": {\n    \"package\": \"^version\"\n  },\n  \"compatibility\": {\n    \"claudeCode\": \">=0.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"systemRequirements\": {\n    \"node\": \">=18.0.0\",\n    \"system\": [\"binary-name\"]\n  },\n  \"envVars\": {\n    \"VAR_NAME\": {\n      \"description\": \"string\",\n      \"required\": true|false,\n      \"example\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"skillBundles\": {\n    \"bundle-name\": [\"skill1\", \"skill2\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Recommendations\n\n1. Create JSON schema validator\n2. Run schema validation in CI/CD\n3. Create plugin.json linter\n4. Add pre-commit hook for manifest validation\n5. Generate documentation from manifests automatically\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: REJECT\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nSUMMARY: Significant inconsistencies (tags vs keywords, dependency array vs object, path format variations) require standardization before scaling the plugin ecosystem.\nKEY_ISSUES: tags/keywords inconsistency, conductor dependencies type mismatch, inconsistent path formats, missing compatibility fields, no unified schema documentation\n```\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: File-by-File Summary\n\n| Plugin | Version | Issues | Strengths |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----------|\n| instantly | 1.0.1 | None major | Clean structure, good keywords |\n| frontend | 3.14.0 | None major | Excellent description with version notes |\n| bun | 1.6.0 | None major | Clean, comprehensive |\n| code-analysis | 3.2.0 | None major | Good version notes in description |\n| agentdev | 1.5.0 | Uses `tags` instead of `keywords`, simplified author | Excellent inline hooks, good docs links |\n| seo | 1.6.0 | None major | Good autonomy description |\n| conductor | 2.1.0 | Uses `tags`, dependencies is array not object | Clean structure |\n| nanobanana | 2.3.0 | Brief description | Clean, minimal |\n| video-editing | 1.1.0 | None major | Good keyword coverage |\n| autopilot | 0.2.0 | None major | **Best practice example**: envVars schema, npmDependencies |\n| dev | 1.29.0 | None major | Comprehensive, excellent version notes |\n| multimodel | 2.2.0 | Uses `tags` | Innovative skillBundles pattern |\n\n**Quality Score**: 7.5/10\n- Valid JSON: ✅\n- Required fields: ✅\n- Consistency: ⚠️ (major variations)\n- Best practices: ⚠️ (some plugins excellent, others basic)\n- Documentation: ⚠️ (no schema reference)\n","numLines":391,"startLine":1,"totalLines":391}}}
