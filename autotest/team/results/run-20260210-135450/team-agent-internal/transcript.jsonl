However, there are **two significant discrepancies** between the manifest and the actual filesystem that require attention.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Schema Correctness and Completeness\\n\\n### ✅ Core Schema Fields (All Present and Valid)\\n\\n- **name**: \\\"dev\\\" (correct)\\n- **version**: \\\"1.29.0\\\" (matches CLAUDE.md and marketplace.json)\\n- **description**: Comprehensive, includes version history and skill count\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, and company\\n- **license**: \\\"MIT\\\" (standard)\\n- **keywords**: Extensive (42 keywords) covering all tech stacks\\n- **category**: \\\"development\\\" (appropriate)\\n- **compatibility**: `claudeCode >= 0.1.0` (standard)\\n\\n### ✅ Component References\\n\\n**Agents**: 15 agents declared in manifest\\n- All 15 agent files exist on disk\\n- One additional agent exists but not referenced (see issues below)\\n\\n**Commands**: 12 commands declared in manifest\\n- All 12 command files exist on disk\\n- One additional command exists but not referenced (see issues below)\\n\\n**Skills**: 44 skill paths declared in manifest\\n- 46 SKILL.md files actually exist on disk\\n- Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but manifest lists 44\\n\\n**MCP Servers**: References `./.mcp.json` (standard format)\\n\\n**Output Styles**: References `./output-styles/self-improving.md` (unique to dev plugin)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n### Similarities (Good Practices)\\n\\n1. **Standard field order**: name → version → description → author → license\\n2. **Relative path references**: All paths use `./` prefix (correct)\\n3. **Author object structure**: Matches frontend and code-analysis patterns\\n4. **Compatibility field**: Present like multimodel and frontend\\n\\n### Differences (Plugin-Specific Features)\\n\\n1. **outputStyles field**: Unique to dev plugin (frontend lacks this)\\n2. **dependencies field**: Declares `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0` (good practice)\\n3. **Keywords vs tags**: Uses \\\"keywords\\\" (like frontend), not \\\"tags\\\" (like multimodel) - both valid\\n4. **No hooks field**: Unlike multimodel which has hooks system\\n5. **No skillBundles field**: Unlike multimodel which groups skills\\n\\nThese differences are **appropriate** for each plugin's purpose and not structural issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🔴 Issue 1: Missing Agent Reference\\n\\n**Agent file exists but not declared in plugin.json:**\\n- File: `plugins/dev/agents/test-architect.md`\\n- Status: **EXISTS on disk, NOT in manifest**\\n- Impact: Agent is invisible to Claude Code plugin system\\n- Severity: **HIGH** - Agent cannot be invoked\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Glob found 16 agent .md files\\n- plugin.json lists 15 agents\\n- Manual verification confirms `test-architect.md` exists\\n\\n### 🔴 Issue 2: Missing Command Reference\\n\\n**Command file exists but not declared in plugin.json:**\\n- File: `plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md`\\n- Status: **EXISTS on disk, NOT in manifest**\\n- Impact: Command is invisible to Claude Code plugin system\\n- Severity: **HIGH** - Command cannot be invoked via `/dev:delegate`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Glob found 13 command .md files\\n- plugin.json lists 12 commands\\n- Manual verification confirms `delegate.md` exists\\n- Context: This is the new task routing command added in recent work (see CLAUDE.md memory)\\n\\n### 🟡 Issue 3: Skill Count Mismatch\\n\\n**Three different numbers:**\\n- Description text: \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Manifest array: 44 skill paths\\n- Filesystem: 46 SKILL.md files\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- Some skill paths in manifest are directories (e.g., `./skills/core/universal-patterns`)\\n- Directory `./skills/core/` contains 3 SKILL.md files (universal-patterns, testing-strategies, debugging-strategies)\\n- Directory `./skills/design/` contains 5 SKILL.md files\\n- Directory `./skills/frontend/` contains 10 SKILL.md files\\n- Directory `./skills/backend/` contains 14 SKILL.md files\\n- Directory `./skills/discipline/` contains 4 SKILL.md files\\n\\n**Verdict:** Skill count discrepancy is **minor** - plugin system handles nested skills correctly. The description should say \\\"46 skills\\\" for accuracy, but this is cosmetic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Version Consistency Check\\n\\n### ✅ All Version References Match\\n\\n- **plugin.json**: `\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.29.0\\\"`\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: Lists Dev Plugin as v1.29.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: `\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.29.0\\\"`\\n- **Git tag expected**: `plugins/dev/v1.29.0`\\n\\nAll three required release artifacts are consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Additional Observations\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive keywords**: 42 keywords cover all supported tech stacks\\n2. **Dependency declaration**: Properly declares multimodel dependency\\n3. **Output styles**: Unique feature for self-improving behavior\\n4. **Descriptive version notes**: Description includes \\\"v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement...\\\"\\n\\n### Minor Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Skill count accuracy**: Update description from \\\"45 skills\\\" to \\\"46 skills\\\" or \\\"44+ skills\\\"\\n2. **Consistent terminology**: Consider \\\"keywords\\\" vs \\\"tags\\\" standardization across all plugins\\n3. **Agent ordering**: Agents in manifest aren't alphabetically sorted (unlike commands)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison Table: Declared vs Actual\\n\\n| Component Type | Declared in plugin.json | Exists on Disk | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Agents | 15 | 16 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\\n| Commands | 12 | 13 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\\n| Skills (paths) | 44 | 46 (SKILL.md files) | ⚠️ Count mismatch |\\n| MCP Servers | 1 config file | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\\n| Output Styles | 1 | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Root Cause Analysis\\n\\nThe missing references suggest **recent development work** where:\\n1. New agent (`test-architect.md`) was created but plugin.json not updated\\n2.

The description should say \\\"46 skills\\\" for accuracy, but this is cosmetic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Version Consistency Check\\n\\n### ✅ All Version References Match\\n\\n- **plugin.json**: `\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.29.0\\\"`\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: Lists Dev Plugin as v1.29.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: `\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.29.0\\\"`\\n- **Git tag expected**: `plugins/dev/v1.29.0`\\n\\nAll three required release artifacts are consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Additional Observations\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive keywords**: 42 keywords cover all supported tech stacks\\n2. **Dependency declaration**: Properly declares multimodel dependency\\n3. **Output styles**: Unique feature for self-improving behavior\\n4. **Descriptive version notes**: Description includes \\\"v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement...\\\"\\n\\n### Minor Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Skill count accuracy**: Update description from \\\"45 skills\\\" to \\\"46 skills\\\" or \\\"44+ skills\\\"\\n2. **Consistent terminology**: Consider \\\"keywords\\\" vs \\\"tags\\\" standardization across all plugins\\n3. **Agent ordering**: Agents in manifest aren't alphabetically sorted (unlike commands)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison Table: Declared vs Actual\\n\\n| Component Type | Declared in plugin.json | Exists on Disk | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Agents | 15 | 16 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\\n| Commands | 12 | 13 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\\n| Skills (paths) | 44 | 46 (SKILL.md files) | ⚠️ Count mismatch |\\n| MCP Servers | 1 config file | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\\n| Output Styles | 1 | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Root Cause Analysis\\n\\nThe missing references suggest **recent development work** where:\\n1. New agent (`test-architect.md`) was created but plugin.json not updated\\n2. New command (`delegate.md`) was created but plugin.json not updated\\n\\nThis aligns with CLAUDE.md memory noting recent work on:\\n- Task routing command (`/dev:delegate`)\\n- Subagent selection improvements\\n- Agent delegation patterns\\n\\n**Hypothesis:** These components were added in recent commits but the plugin.json manifest update was missed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Commands Used\\n\\n```bash\\n# Agent verification\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/*.md | wc -l\\n# Output: 16 (vs 15 declared)\\n\\n# Command verification\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/*.md | wc -l\\n# Output: 13 (vs 12 declared)\\n\\n# Skill verification\\nfind /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills -name \\\"SKILL.md\\\" | wc -l\\n# Output: 46 (vs 44 paths declared)\\n\\n# File lists\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/ | sort\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/ | sort\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Assessment\\n\\n### Immediate Impact\\n\\n**test-architect agent:**\\n- Cannot be invoked via Task tool\\n- Not visible in `/dev:help` or plugin documentation\\n- Fully implemented but effectively disabled\\n\\n**delegate command:**\\n- Cannot be invoked via `/dev:delegate`\\n- Task routing workflow broken\\n- Recent feature investment unusable\\n\\n### Release Impact\\n\\nIf released with current plugin.json:\\n- v1.29.0 would ship with incomplete manifest\\n- Users cannot access 2 components they should have\\n- Marketplace listing would be inaccurate\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n\\n### Required (Blocking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Add test-architect agent** to plugin.json `agents` array:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Add delegate command** to plugin.json `commands` array:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Update version** to v1.29.1 or v1.30.0 (depending on semver policy)\\n\\n4. **Update marketplace.json** to match new plugin version\\n\\n5. **Create git tag** with corrected version\\n\\n### Optional (Quality Improvements)\\n\\n1.

However, there are **two significant discrepancies** between the manifest and the actual filesystem that require attention.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Schema Correctness and Completeness\\n\\n### ✅ Core Schema Fields (All Present and Valid)\\n\\n- **name**: \\\"dev\\\" (correct)\\n- **version**: \\\"1.29.0\\\" (matches CLAUDE.md and marketplace.json)\\n- **description**: Comprehensive, includes version history and skill count\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, and company\\n- **license**: \\\"MIT\\\" (standard)\\n- **keywords**: Extensive (42 keywords) covering all tech stacks\\n- **category**: \\\"development\\\" (appropriate)\\n- **compatibility**: `claudeCode >= 0.1.0` (standard)\\n\\n### ✅ Component References\\n\\n**Agents**: 15 agents declared in manifest\\n- All 15 agent files exist on disk\\n- One additional agent exists but not referenced (see issues below)\\n\\n**Commands**: 12 commands declared in manifest\\n- All 12 command files exist on disk\\n- One additional command exists but not referenced (see issues below)\\n\\n**Skills**: 44 skill paths declared in manifest\\n- 46 SKILL.md files actually exist on disk\\n- Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but manifest lists 44\\n\\n**MCP Servers**: References `./.mcp.json` (standard format)\\n\\n**Output Styles**: References `./output-styles/self-improving.md` (unique to dev plugin)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n### Similarities (Good Practices)\\n\\n1. **Standard field order**: name → version → description → author → license\\n2. **Relative path references**: All paths use `./` prefix (correct)\\n3. **Author object structure**: Matches frontend and code-analysis patterns\\n4. **Compatibility field**: Present like multimodel and frontend\\n\\n### Differences (Plugin-Specific Features)\\n\\n1. **outputStyles field**: Unique to dev plugin (frontend lacks this)\\n2. **dependencies field**: Declares `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0` (good practice)\\n3. **Keywords vs tags**: Uses \\\"keywords\\\" (like frontend), not \\\"tags\\\" (like multimodel) - both valid\\n4. **No hooks field**: Unlike multimodel which has hooks system\\n5. **No skillBundles field**: Unlike multimodel which groups skills\\n\\nThese differences are **appropriate** for each plugin's purpose and not structural issues.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🔴 Issue 1: Missing Agent Reference\\n\\n**Agent file exists but not declared in plugin.json:**\\n- File: `plugins/dev/agents/test-architect.md`\\n- Status: **EXISTS on disk, NOT in manifest**\\n- Impact: Agent is invisible to Claude Code plugin system\\n- Severity: **HIGH** - Agent cannot be invoked\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Glob found 16 agent .md files\\n- plugin.json lists 15 agents\\n- Manual verification confirms `test-architect.md` exists\\n\\n### 🔴 Issue 2: Missing Command Reference\\n\\n**Command file exists but not declared in plugin.json:**\\n- File: `plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md`\\n- Status: **EXISTS on disk, NOT in manifest**\\n- Impact: Command is invisible to Claude Code plugin system\\n- Severity: **HIGH** - Command cannot be invoked via `/dev:delegate`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Glob found 13 command .md files\\n- plugin.json lists 12 commands\\n- Manual verification confirms `delegate.md` exists\\n- Context: This is the new task routing command added in recent work (see CLAUDE.md memory)\\n\\n### 🟡 Issue 3: Skill Count Mismatch\\n\\n**Three different numbers:**\\n- Description text: \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Manifest array: 44 skill paths\\n- Filesystem: 46 SKILL.md files\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- Some skill paths in manifest are directories (e.g., `./skills/core/universal-patterns`)\\n- Directory `./skills/core/` contains 3 SKILL.md files (universal-patterns, testing-strategies, debugging-strategies)\\n- Directory `./skills/design/` contains 5 SKILL.md files\\n- Directory `./skills/frontend/` contains 10 SKILL.md files\\n- Directory `./skills/backend/` contains 14 SKILL.md files\\n- Directory `./skills/discipline/` contains 4 SKILL.md files\\n\\n**Verdict:** Skill count discrepancy is **minor** - plugin system handles nested skills correctly. The description should say \\\"46 skills\\\" for accuracy, but this is cosmetic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Version Consistency Check\\n\\n### ✅ All Version References Match\\n\\n- **plugin.json**: `\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.29.0\\\"`\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: Lists Dev Plugin as v1.29.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: `\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.29.0\\\"`\\n- **Git tag expected**: `plugins/dev/v1.29.0`\\n\\nAll three required release artifacts are consistent.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Additional Observations\\n\\n### Strengths\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive keywords**: 42 keywords cover all supported tech stacks\\n2. **Dependency declaration**: Properly declares multimodel dependency\\n3. **Output styles**: Unique feature for self-improving behavior\\n4. **Descriptive version notes**: Description includes \\\"v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement...\\\"\\n\\n### Minor Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Skill count accuracy**: Update description from \\\"45 skills\\\" to \\\"46 skills\\\" or \\\"44+ skills\\\"\\n2. **Consistent terminology**: Consider \\\"keywords\\\" vs \\\"tags\\\" standardization across all plugins\\n3. **Agent ordering**: Agents in manifest aren't alphabetically sorted (unlike commands)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison Table: Declared vs Actual\\n\\n| Component Type | Declared in plugin.json | Exists on Disk | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Agents | 15 | 16 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\\n| Commands | 12 | 13 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\\n| Skills (paths) | 44 | 46 (SKILL.md files) | ⚠️ Count mismatch |\\n| MCP Servers | 1 config file | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\\n| Output Styles | 1 | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Root Cause Analysis\\n\\nThe missing references suggest **recent development work** where:\\n1. New agent (`test-architect.md`) was created but plugin.json not updated\\n2.

However, there are **two significant discrepancies** between the manifest and the actual filesystem that require attention.\n\n---\n\n## Schema Correctness and Completeness\n\n### ✅ Core Schema Fields (All Present and Valid)\n\n- **name**: \"dev\" (correct)\n- **version**: \"1.29.0\" (matches CLAUDE.md and marketplace.json)\n- **description**: Comprehensive, includes version history and skill count\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, and company\n- **license**: \"MIT\" (standard)\n- **keywords**: Extensive (42 keywords) covering all tech stacks\n- **category**: \"development\" (appropriate)\n- **compatibility**: `claudeCode >= 0.1.0` (standard)\n\n### ✅ Component References\n\n**Agents**: 15 agents declared in manifest\n- All 15 agent files exist on disk\n- One additional agent exists but not referenced (see issues below)\n\n**Commands**: 12 commands declared in manifest\n- All 12 command files exist on disk\n- One additional command exists but not referenced (see issues below)\n\n**Skills**: 44 skill paths declared in manifest\n- 46 SKILL.md files actually exist on disk\n- Description claims \"45 skills\" but manifest lists 44\n\n**MCP Servers**: References `./.mcp.json` (standard format)\n\n**Output Styles**: References `./output-styles/self-improving.md` (unique to dev plugin)\n\n---\n\n## Structural Comparison with Other Plugins\n\n### Similarities (Good Practices)\n\n1. **Standard field order**: name → version → description → author → license\n2. **Relative path references**: All paths use `./` prefix (correct)\n3. **Author object structure**: Matches frontend and code-analysis patterns\n4. **Compatibility field**: Present like multimodel and frontend\n\n### Differences (Plugin-Specific Features)\n\n1. **outputStyles field**: Unique to dev plugin (frontend lacks this)\n2. **dependencies field**: Declares `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0` (good practice)\n3. **Keywords vs tags**: Uses \"keywords\" (like frontend), not \"tags\" (like multimodel) - both valid\n4. **No hooks field**: Unlike multimodel which has hooks system\n5. **No skillBundles field**: Unlike multimodel which groups skills\n\nThese differences are **appropriate** for each plugin's purpose and not structural issues.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues Identified\n\n### 🔴 Issue 1: Missing Agent Reference\n\n**Agent file exists but not declared in plugin.json:**\n- File: `plugins/dev/agents/test-architect.md`\n- Status: **EXISTS on disk, NOT in manifest**\n- Impact: Agent is invisible to Claude Code plugin system\n- Severity: **HIGH** - Agent cannot be invoked\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Glob found 16 agent .md files\n- plugin.json lists 15 agents\n- Manual verification confirms `test-architect.md` exists\n\n### 🔴 Issue 2: Missing Command Reference\n\n**Command file exists but not declared in plugin.json:**\n- File: `plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md`\n- Status: **EXISTS on disk, NOT in manifest**\n- Impact: Command is invisible to Claude Code plugin system\n- Severity: **HIGH** - Command cannot be invoked via `/dev:delegate`\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Glob found 13 command .md files\n- plugin.json lists 12 commands\n- Manual verification confirms `delegate.md` exists\n- Context: This is the new task routing command added in recent work (see CLAUDE.md memory)\n\n### 🟡 Issue 3: Skill Count Mismatch\n\n**Three different numbers:**\n- Description text: \"45 skills\"\n- Manifest array: 44 skill paths\n- Filesystem: 46 SKILL.md files\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Some skill paths in manifest are directories (e.g., `./skills/core/universal-patterns`)\n- Directory `./skills/core/` contains 3 SKILL.md files (universal-patterns, testing-strategies, debugging-strategies)\n- Directory `./skills/design/` contains 5 SKILL.md files\n- Directory `./skills/frontend/` contains 10 SKILL.md files\n- Directory `./skills/backend/` contains 14 SKILL.md files\n- Directory `./skills/discipline/` contains 4 SKILL.md files\n\n**Verdict:** Skill count discrepancy is **minor** - plugin system handles nested skills correctly. The description should say \"46 skills\" for accuracy, but this is cosmetic.\n\n---\n\n## Version Consistency Check\n\n### ✅ All Version References Match\n\n- **plugin.json**: `\"version\": \"1.29.0\"`\n- **CLAUDE.md**: Lists Dev Plugin as v1.29.0\n- **marketplace.json**: `\"version\": \"1.29.0\"`\n- **Git tag expected**: `plugins/dev/v1.29.0`\n\nAll three required release artifacts are consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Observations\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. **Comprehensive keywords**: 42 keywords cover all supported tech stacks\n2. **Dependency declaration**: Properly declares multimodel dependency\n3. **Output styles**: Unique feature for self-improving behavior\n4. **Descriptive version notes**: Description includes \"v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement...\"\n\n### Minor Recommendations\n\n1. **Skill count accuracy**: Update description from \"45 skills\" to \"46 skills\" or \"44+ skills\"\n2. **Consistent terminology**: Consider \"keywords\" vs \"tags\" standardization across all plugins\n3. **Agent ordering**: Agents in manifest aren't alphabetically sorted (unlike commands)\n\n---\n\n## Comparison Table: Declared vs Actual\n\n| Component Type | Declared in plugin.json | Exists on Disk | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Agents | 15 | 16 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\n| Commands | 12 | 13 | ❌ Missing 1 reference |\n| Skills (paths) | 44 | 46 (SKILL.md files) | ⚠️ Count mismatch |\n| MCP Servers | 1 config file | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\n| Output Styles | 1 | Not verified | ✅ Assumed valid |\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe missing references suggest **recent development work** where:\n1. New agent (`test-architect.md`) was created but plugin.json not updated\n2. New command (`delegate.md`) was created but plugin.json not updated\n\nThis aligns with CLAUDE.md memory noting recent work on:\n- Task routing command (`/dev:delegate`)\n- Subagent selection improvements\n- Agent delegation patterns\n\n**Hypothesis:** These components were added in recent commits but the plugin.json manifest update was missed.\n\n---\n\n## Verification Commands Used\n\n```bash\n# Agent verification\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/*.md | wc -l\n# Output: 16 (vs 15 declared)\n\n# Command verification\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/*.md | wc -l\n# Output: 13 (vs 12 declared)\n\n# Skill verification\nfind /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills -name \"SKILL.md\" | wc -l\n# Output: 46 (vs 44 paths declared)\n\n# File lists\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/ | sort\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/ | sort\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\n### Immediate Impact\n\n**test-architect agent:**\n- Cannot be invoked via Task tool\n- Not visible in `/dev:help` or plugin documentation\n- Fully implemented but effectively disabled\n\n**delegate command:**\n- Cannot be invoked via `/dev:delegate`\n- Task routing workflow broken\n- Recent feature investment unusable\n\n### Release Impact\n\nIf released with current plugin.json:\n- v1.29.0 would ship with incomplete manifest\n- Users cannot access 2 components they should have\n- Marketplace listing would be inaccurate\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Actions\n\n### Required (Blocking Issues)\n\n1. **Add test-architect agent** to plugin.json `agents` array:\n   ```json\n   \"./agents/test-architect.md\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Add delegate command** to plugin.json `commands` array:\n   ```json\n   \"./commands/delegate.md\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Update version** to v1.29.1 or v1.30.0 (depending on semver policy)\n\n4. **Update marketplace.json** to match new plugin version\n\n5. **Create git tag** with corrected version\n\n### Optional (Quality Improvements)\n\n1. Update skill count in description from \"45 skills\" to \"46 skills\"\n2. Alphabetize agent list in manifest for maintainability\n3. Add validation script to prevent manifest/filesystem drift\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: REJECT\nCONFIDENCE: 10\nSUMMARY: Two critical omissions - test-architect agent and delegate command exist on disk but are missing from plugin.json manifest, rendering them unusable\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing test-architect.md agent reference, Missing delegate.md command reference, Skill count discrepancy (45 vs 44 vs 46)\n```\n","numLines":247,"startLine":1,"totalLines":247}}}
