Frontend Plugin\\n- **plugin.json**: 3.14.0\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: 3.13.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: NOT LISTED\\n- **Issue**: plugin.json ahead by 0.1.0, missing from marketplace\\n\\n#### 2. Code Analysis Plugin\\n- **plugin.json**: 3.2.0\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: 2.15.0 (with note \\\"v3.0.0: ENRICHMENT MODE\\\")\\n- **marketplace.json**: 3.2.0\\n- **Issue**: CLAUDE.md lists v2.15.0 but describes v3.0.0 features\\n\\n#### 3.

Code Analysis Version Confusion\\nCLAUDE.md lists version as \\\"v2.15.0\\\" in the \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (line 217), but the \\\"Latest Changes\\\" section (line 227) describes features for \\\"v3.0.0\\\". The actual plugin.json is at 3.2.0.\\n\\n### 3. Systematic CLAUDE.md Lag\\n8 out of 10 plugins have CLAUDE.md trailing behind the actual plugin versions, suggesting documentation is not being updated during releases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Checklist Violations\\n\\nPer CLAUDE.md lines 247-253, the release checklist states:\\n\\n> **⚠️ RELEASE CHECKLIST (ALL 3 REQUIRED):**\\n> When releasing a plugin, you MUST update ALL THREE of these:\\n> 1. **Plugin version** - `plugins/{name}/plugin.json` → `\\\"version\\\": \\\"X.Y.Z\\\"`\\n> 2. **Marketplace version** - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin entry `\\\"version\\\": \\\"X.Y.Z\\\"`\\n> 3. **Git tag** - `git tag -a plugins/{name}/vX.Y.Z -m \\\"Release message\\\"` → push with `--tags`\\n>\\n> Missing any of these will cause claudeup to not see the update!\\n\\n**Violations Found**:\\n- **8 plugins** have CLAUDE.md not updated (#1 violated in spirit)\\n- **2 plugins** missing from marketplace.json entirely (#2 violated)\\n- Git tags not verified in this analysis (#3 cannot assess without checking git)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n\\n1. **Immediate**: Add `frontend` and `bun` entries to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n2. **Immediate**: Update CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224) with correct versions:\\n   - Multimodel: 2.0.0 → 2.2.0\\n   - Code Analysis: 2.15.0 → 3.2.0 (and clarify v3.0.0 notes)\\n   - Agentdev: 1.4.0 → 1.5.0\\n   - SEO: 1.5.1 → 1.6.0\\n   - Video Editing: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0\\n   - Nanobanana: 2.2.3 → 2.3.0\\n   - Conductor: 2.0.1 → 2.1.0\\n   - Bun: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0\\n   - Frontend: 3.13.0 → 3.14.0\\n3. **Process**: Enforce release checklist automation or pre-commit hook\\n4. **Process**: Add CLAUDE.md update to release script/skill\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Version Comparison Table\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | CLAUDE.md | marketplace.json | Match?

Frontend Plugin\\n- **plugin.json**: 3.14.0\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: 3.13.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: NOT LISTED\\n- **Issue**: plugin.json ahead by 0.1.0, missing from marketplace\\n\\n#### 2.

Missing Marketplace Entries\\n**Frontend** and **Bun** plugins are not listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at all. This violates the release checklist requirement that all three sources must be updated.\\n\\n### 2. Code Analysis Version Confusion\\nCLAUDE.md lists version as \\\"v2.15.0\\\" in the \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (line 217), but the \\\"Latest Changes\\\" section (line 227) describes features for \\\"v3.0.0\\\". The actual plugin.json is at 3.2.0.\\n\\n### 3. Systematic CLAUDE.md Lag\\n8 out of 10 plugins have CLAUDE.md trailing behind the actual plugin versions, suggesting documentation is not being updated during releases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release Checklist Violations\\n\\nPer CLAUDE.md lines 247-253, the release checklist states:\\n\\n> **⚠️ RELEASE CHECKLIST (ALL 3 REQUIRED):**\\n> When releasing a plugin, you MUST update ALL THREE of these:\\n> 1. **Plugin version** - `plugins/{name}/plugin.json` → `\\\"version\\\": \\\"X.Y.Z\\\"`\\n> 2. **Marketplace version** - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin entry `\\\"version\\\": \\\"X.Y.Z\\\"`\\n> 3. **Git tag** - `git tag -a plugins/{name}/vX.Y.Z -m \\\"Release message\\\"` → push with `--tags`\\n>\\n> Missing any of these will cause claudeup to not see the update!\\n\\n**Violations Found**:\\n- **8 plugins** have CLAUDE.md not updated (#1 violated in spirit)\\n- **2 plugins** missing from marketplace.json entirely (#2 violated)\\n- Git tags not verified in this analysis (#3 cannot assess without checking git)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n\\n1. **Immediate**: Add `frontend` and `bun` entries to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n2. **Immediate**: Update CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224) with correct versions:\\n   - Multimodel: 2.0.0 → 2.2.0\\n   - Code Analysis: 2.15.0 → 3.2.0 (and clarify v3.0.0 notes)\\n   - Agentdev: 1.4.0 → 1.5.0\\n   - SEO: 1.5.1 → 1.6.0\\n   - Video Editing: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0\\n   - Nanobanana: 2.2.3 → 2.3.0\\n   - Conductor: 2.0.1 → 2.1.0\\n   - Bun: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0\\n   - Frontend: 3.13.0 → 3.14.0\\n3. **Process**: Enforce release checklist automation or pre-commit hook\\n4. **Process**: Add CLAUDE.md update to release script/skill\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Version Comparison Table\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | CLAUDE.md | marketplace.json | Match?
