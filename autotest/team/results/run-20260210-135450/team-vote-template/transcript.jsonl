It exceeds baseline requirements with a strong value proposition, detailed plugin documentation, and extensive cross-references to deeper documentation. However, there are **minor gaps** in troubleshooting coverage and contributing guidelines that prevent a perfect score.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Section-by-Section Evaluation\\n\\n### ✅ 1. Project Title and Description\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Clear title: \\\"MAG Claude Plugins\\\"\\n- Compelling tagline: \\\"Battle-tested AI workflows from the top 1% of developers\\\"\\n- Strong value proposition (lines 8-62) with quantified benefits ($2.3M value, 156+ hours saved, 47 features shipped)\\n- Badges for license and maintainer\\n\\n**Quality**: Exceeds requirements with a powerful narrative that clearly communicates project purpose and value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 2. Installation/Setup Instructions\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Quick Start section (lines 78-101) with minimal setup steps\\n- Comprehensive \\\"Installation & Setup\\\" section (lines 294-407)\\n- Clear prerequisites (lines 298-313)\\n- Recommended setup pattern with 3-step process (lines 315-382)\\n- Update instructions (lines 66-74)\\n- Team collaboration workflow explained (lines 349-365)\\n\\n**Quality**: Clear, actionable, with multiple approaches (quick start + detailed). Includes team workflow which is crucial for enterprise adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 3. Usage Examples\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"Usage Guide\\\" section (lines 409-460)\\n- Two concrete examples:\\n  - `/implement` command (lines 422-435)\\n  - `/import-figma` command (lines 437-443)\\n- Cross-reference to comprehensive guide for more examples (lines 447-458)\\n\\n**Quality**: Provides actionable examples but limited to 2 use cases in main README. However, cross-references to `docs/frontend.md` for detailed examples, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 4. Available Plugins\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"What's Inside\\\" section (lines 104-293)\\n- Detailed descriptions for 5 plugins:\\n  - Frontend Development (lines 110-156) - most detailed\\n  - Code Analysis (lines 159-174)\\n  - Bun Backend Development (lines 176-202)\\n  - Orchestration (lines 205-238)\\n  - Claudish CLI (lines 242-292)\\n- Each includes: version, category, highlights, \\\"Perfect for\\\" use cases\\n- Frontend plugin includes detailed workflow breakdown\\n\\n**Quality**: Very comprehensive with version numbers, feature highlights, and clear use case descriptions. Each plugin has enough detail to make an informed decision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 5. Configuration\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Settings format specified (lines 302-309)\\n- Plugin enablement examples (lines 87-98, 331-340, 368-381)\\n- Cross-reference to environment variables in technical docs (line 531 - DEPENDENCIES.md)\\n- Team configuration mentioned (lines 359-365)\\n\\n**Quality**: Configuration is covered but environment variables are not detailed in the main README (they're in separate docs). For a professional project, having a brief \\\"Configuration\\\" section with common environment variables would be ideal.\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No dedicated \\\"Configuration\\\" section consolidating all config options.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ❌ 6. Contributing Guidelines\\n**Status**: MISSING\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- No \\\"Contributing\\\" section in main README\\n- Reference to contributing docs exists (line 473: `./docs/contributing.md`)\\n- No inline guidance on how to contribute (bug reports, feature requests, PRs)\\n- Community requests mentioned (lines 506-507) but only for plugin ideas\\n\\n**Critical Gap**: While contributing docs are referenced, best practice is to have at least a brief \\\"Contributing\\\" section in the main README with:\\n- How to report bugs\\n- How to request features\\n- Link to full contributing guide\\n- Code of conduct (if applicable)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 7. License\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- License badge at top (line 5)\\n- Dedicated \\\"License\\\" section (lines 536-540)\\n- MIT License clearly stated\\n- Note about individual plugin licenses\\n\\n**Quality**: Clear and complete.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 8. Requirements/Dependencies\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"Prerequisites\\\" section (lines 298-313)\\n- System requirements listed:\\n  - Claude Code version requirements\\n  - Plugin system requirements\\n  - Git access\\n- Cross-reference to detailed dependencies (line 531: DEPENDENCIES.md)\\n\\n**Quality**: Basic requirements covered. More detailed dependencies are in separate docs, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No mention of Node.js, Chrome, or other system-level dependencies in main README (though they may be in linked docs).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 9. Architecture Overview\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- High-level architecture implicit in plugin descriptions\\n- Cross-references to technical documentation (lines 478-534):\\n  - TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md\\n  - DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md\\n  - COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md\\n- Plugin structure described in installation section\\n\\n**Quality**: Architecture is covered through cross-references rather than inline explanation. For a marketplace project, this is acceptable as the architecture is primarily \\\"plugin-based system.\\\"\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No diagram or visual representation of system architecture in main README.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ⚠️ 10. Troubleshooting/FAQ\\n**Status**: WEAK\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Brief troubleshooting mention in \\\"Verify Installation\\\" (lines 402-405)\\n- Lists 3 common issues (plugin not showing, doctor errors, activation)\\n- Cross-reference to troubleshooting docs (line 467: `./docs/troubleshooting.md`)\\n\\n**Critical Gap**: Only 3 bullet points for common issues. No FAQ section. While detailed troubleshooting is in separate docs, a README should have at least 5-10 common issues with quick solutions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Additional Sections (Beyond Requirements)\\n\\n### ✅ Update Instructions\\n- Clear update command (lines 66-74)\\n- Important for maintenance\\n\\n### ✅ Roadmap\\n- Current focus and future plans (lines 488-508)\\n- Shows active development\\n\\n### ✅ Contact & Support\\n- Multiple contact methods (lines 560-566)\\n- Email, issues, discussions, website\\n\\n### ✅ Maintainers\\n- Clear ownership (lines 544-548)\\n\\n### ✅ Acknowledgments\\n- Credits to Claude Code and community (lines 552-556)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quality Assessment by Section\\n\\n| Section | Status | Quality Score (1-10) |\\n|---------|--------|---------------------|\\n| 1.

It exceeds baseline requirements with a strong value proposition, detailed plugin documentation, and extensive cross-references to deeper documentation. However, there are **minor gaps** in troubleshooting coverage and contributing guidelines that prevent a perfect score.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Section-by-Section Evaluation\\n\\n### ✅ 1. Project Title and Description\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Clear title: \\\"MAG Claude Plugins\\\"\\n- Compelling tagline: \\\"Battle-tested AI workflows from the top 1% of developers\\\"\\n- Strong value proposition (lines 8-62) with quantified benefits ($2.3M value, 156+ hours saved, 47 features shipped)\\n- Badges for license and maintainer\\n\\n**Quality**: Exceeds requirements with a powerful narrative that clearly communicates project purpose and value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 2. Installation/Setup Instructions\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Quick Start section (lines 78-101) with minimal setup steps\\n- Comprehensive \\\"Installation & Setup\\\" section (lines 294-407)\\n- Clear prerequisites (lines 298-313)\\n- Recommended setup pattern with 3-step process (lines 315-382)\\n- Update instructions (lines 66-74)\\n- Team collaboration workflow explained (lines 349-365)\\n\\n**Quality**: Clear, actionable, with multiple approaches (quick start + detailed). Includes team workflow which is crucial for enterprise adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 3. Usage Examples\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"Usage Guide\\\" section (lines 409-460)\\n- Two concrete examples:\\n  - `/implement` command (lines 422-435)\\n  - `/import-figma` command (lines 437-443)\\n- Cross-reference to comprehensive guide for more examples (lines 447-458)\\n\\n**Quality**: Provides actionable examples but limited to 2 use cases in main README. However, cross-references to `docs/frontend.md` for detailed examples, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 4. Available Plugins\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"What's Inside\\\" section (lines 104-293)\\n- Detailed descriptions for 5 plugins:\\n  - Frontend Development (lines 110-156) - most detailed\\n  - Code Analysis (lines 159-174)\\n  - Bun Backend Development (lines 176-202)\\n  - Orchestration (lines 205-238)\\n  - Claudish CLI (lines 242-292)\\n- Each includes: version, category, highlights, \\\"Perfect for\\\" use cases\\n- Frontend plugin includes detailed workflow breakdown\\n\\n**Quality**: Very comprehensive with version numbers, feature highlights, and clear use case descriptions. Each plugin has enough detail to make an informed decision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 5. Configuration\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Settings format specified (lines 302-309)\\n- Plugin enablement examples (lines 87-98, 331-340, 368-381)\\n- Cross-reference to environment variables in technical docs (line 531 - DEPENDENCIES.md)\\n- Team configuration mentioned (lines 359-365)\\n\\n**Quality**: Configuration is covered but environment variables are not detailed in the main README (they're in separate docs). For a professional project, having a brief \\\"Configuration\\\" section with common environment variables would be ideal.\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No dedicated \\\"Configuration\\\" section consolidating all config options.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ❌ 6. Contributing Guidelines\\n**Status**: MISSING\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- No \\\"Contributing\\\" section in main README\\n- Reference to contributing docs exists (line 473: `./docs/contributing.md`)\\n- No inline guidance on how to contribute (bug reports, feature requests, PRs)\\n- Community requests mentioned (lines 506-507) but only for plugin ideas\\n\\n**Critical Gap**: While contributing docs are referenced, best practice is to have at least a brief \\\"Contributing\\\" section in the main README with:\\n- How to report bugs\\n- How to request features\\n- Link to full contributing guide\\n- Code of conduct (if applicable)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 7. License\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- License badge at top (line 5)\\n- Dedicated \\\"License\\\" section (lines 536-540)\\n- MIT License clearly stated\\n- Note about individual plugin licenses\\n\\n**Quality**: Clear and complete.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 8. Requirements/Dependencies\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"Prerequisites\\\" section (lines 298-313)\\n- System requirements listed:\\n  - Claude Code version requirements\\n  - Plugin system requirements\\n  - Git access\\n- Cross-reference to detailed dependencies (line 531: DEPENDENCIES.md)\\n\\n**Quality**: Basic requirements covered. More detailed dependencies are in separate docs, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No mention of Node.js, Chrome, or other system-level dependencies in main README (though they may be in linked docs).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 9. Architecture Overview\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- High-level architecture implicit in plugin descriptions\\n- Cross-references to technical documentation (lines 478-534):\\n  - TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md\\n  - DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md\\n  - COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md\\n- Plugin structure described in installation section\\n\\n**Quality**: Architecture is covered through cross-references rather than inline explanation. For a marketplace project, this is acceptable as the architecture is primarily \\\"plugin-based system.\\\"\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No diagram or visual representation of system architecture in main README.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ⚠️ 10. Troubleshooting/FAQ\\n**Status**: WEAK\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Brief troubleshooting mention in \\\"Verify Installation\\\" (lines 402-405)\\n- Lists 3 common issues (plugin not showing, doctor errors, activation)\\n- Cross-reference to troubleshooting docs (line 467: `./docs/troubleshooting.md`)\\n\\n**Critical Gap**: Only 3 bullet points for common issues. No FAQ section. While detailed troubleshooting is in separate docs, a README should have at least 5-10 common issues with quick solutions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Additional Sections (Beyond Requirements)\\n\\n### ✅ Update Instructions\\n- Clear update command (lines 66-74)\\n- Important for maintenance\\n\\n### ✅ Roadmap\\n- Current focus and future plans (lines 488-508)\\n- Shows active development\\n\\n### ✅ Contact & Support\\n- Multiple contact methods (lines 560-566)\\n- Email, issues, discussions, website\\n\\n### ✅ Maintainers\\n- Clear ownership (lines 544-548)\\n\\n### ✅ Acknowledgments\\n- Credits to Claude Code and community (lines 552-556)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quality Assessment by Section\\n\\n| Section | Status | Quality Score (1-10) |\\n|---------|--------|---------------------|\\n| 1.

It exceeds baseline requirements with a strong value proposition, detailed plugin documentation, and extensive cross-references to deeper documentation. However, there are **minor gaps** in troubleshooting coverage and contributing guidelines that prevent a perfect score.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Section-by-Section Evaluation\\n\\n### ✅ 1. Project Title and Description\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Clear title: \\\"MAG Claude Plugins\\\"\\n- Compelling tagline: \\\"Battle-tested AI workflows from the top 1% of developers\\\"\\n- Strong value proposition (lines 8-62) with quantified benefits ($2.3M value, 156+ hours saved, 47 features shipped)\\n- Badges for license and maintainer\\n\\n**Quality**: Exceeds requirements with a powerful narrative that clearly communicates project purpose and value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 2. Installation/Setup Instructions\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Quick Start section (lines 78-101) with minimal setup steps\\n- Comprehensive \\\"Installation & Setup\\\" section (lines 294-407)\\n- Clear prerequisites (lines 298-313)\\n- Recommended setup pattern with 3-step process (lines 315-382)\\n- Update instructions (lines 66-74)\\n- Team collaboration workflow explained (lines 349-365)\\n\\n**Quality**: Clear, actionable, with multiple approaches (quick start + detailed). Includes team workflow which is crucial for enterprise adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 3. Usage Examples\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"Usage Guide\\\" section (lines 409-460)\\n- Two concrete examples:\\n  - `/implement` command (lines 422-435)\\n  - `/import-figma` command (lines 437-443)\\n- Cross-reference to comprehensive guide for more examples (lines 447-458)\\n\\n**Quality**: Provides actionable examples but limited to 2 use cases in main README. However, cross-references to `docs/frontend.md` for detailed examples, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 4. Available Plugins\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"What's Inside\\\" section (lines 104-293)\\n- Detailed descriptions for 5 plugins:\\n  - Frontend Development (lines 110-156) - most detailed\\n  - Code Analysis (lines 159-174)\\n  - Bun Backend Development (lines 176-202)\\n  - Orchestration (lines 205-238)\\n  - Claudish CLI (lines 242-292)\\n- Each includes: version, category, highlights, \\\"Perfect for\\\" use cases\\n- Frontend plugin includes detailed workflow breakdown\\n\\n**Quality**: Very comprehensive with version numbers, feature highlights, and clear use case descriptions. Each plugin has enough detail to make an informed decision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 5. Configuration\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Settings format specified (lines 302-309)\\n- Plugin enablement examples (lines 87-98, 331-340, 368-381)\\n- Cross-reference to environment variables in technical docs (line 531 - DEPENDENCIES.md)\\n- Team configuration mentioned (lines 359-365)\\n\\n**Quality**: Configuration is covered but environment variables are not detailed in the main README (they're in separate docs). For a professional project, having a brief \\\"Configuration\\\" section with common environment variables would be ideal.\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No dedicated \\\"Configuration\\\" section consolidating all config options.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ❌ 6. Contributing Guidelines\\n**Status**: MISSING\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- No \\\"Contributing\\\" section in main README\\n- Reference to contributing docs exists (line 473: `./docs/contributing.md`)\\n- No inline guidance on how to contribute (bug reports, feature requests, PRs)\\n- Community requests mentioned (lines 506-507) but only for plugin ideas\\n\\n**Critical Gap**: While contributing docs are referenced, best practice is to have at least a brief \\\"Contributing\\\" section in the main README with:\\n- How to report bugs\\n- How to request features\\n- Link to full contributing guide\\n- Code of conduct (if applicable)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 7. License\\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- License badge at top (line 5)\\n- Dedicated \\\"License\\\" section (lines 536-540)\\n- MIT License clearly stated\\n- Note about individual plugin licenses\\n\\n**Quality**: Clear and complete.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 8. Requirements/Dependencies\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- \\\"Prerequisites\\\" section (lines 298-313)\\n- System requirements listed:\\n  - Claude Code version requirements\\n  - Plugin system requirements\\n  - Git access\\n- Cross-reference to detailed dependencies (line 531: DEPENDENCIES.md)\\n\\n**Quality**: Basic requirements covered. More detailed dependencies are in separate docs, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No mention of Node.js, Chrome, or other system-level dependencies in main README (though they may be in linked docs).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ✅ 9. Architecture Overview\\n**Status**: GOOD\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- High-level architecture implicit in plugin descriptions\\n- Cross-references to technical documentation (lines 478-534):\\n  - TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md\\n  - DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md\\n  - COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md\\n- Plugin structure described in installation section\\n\\n**Quality**: Architecture is covered through cross-references rather than inline explanation. For a marketplace project, this is acceptable as the architecture is primarily \\\"plugin-based system.\\\"\\n\\n**Minor Gap**: No diagram or visual representation of system architecture in main README.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ⚠️ 10. Troubleshooting/FAQ\\n**Status**: WEAK\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Brief troubleshooting mention in \\\"Verify Installation\\\" (lines 402-405)\\n- Lists 3 common issues (plugin not showing, doctor errors, activation)\\n- Cross-reference to troubleshooting docs (line 467: `./docs/troubleshooting.md`)\\n\\n**Critical Gap**: Only 3 bullet points for common issues. No FAQ section. While detailed troubleshooting is in separate docs, a README should have at least 5-10 common issues with quick solutions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Additional Sections (Beyond Requirements)\\n\\n### ✅ Update Instructions\\n- Clear update command (lines 66-74)\\n- Important for maintenance\\n\\n### ✅ Roadmap\\n- Current focus and future plans (lines 488-508)\\n- Shows active development\\n\\n### ✅ Contact & Support\\n- Multiple contact methods (lines 560-566)\\n- Email, issues, discussions, website\\n\\n### ✅ Maintainers\\n- Clear ownership (lines 544-548)\\n\\n### ✅ Acknowledgments\\n- Credits to Claude Code and community (lines 552-556)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quality Assessment by Section\\n\\n| Section | Status | Quality Score (1-10) |\\n|---------|--------|---------------------|\\n| 1.

It exceeds baseline requirements with a strong value proposition, detailed plugin documentation, and extensive cross-references to deeper documentation. However, there are **minor gaps** in troubleshooting coverage and contributing guidelines that prevent a perfect score.\n\n---\n\n## Section-by-Section Evaluation\n\n### ✅ 1. Project Title and Description\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Clear title: \"MAG Claude Plugins\"\n- Compelling tagline: \"Battle-tested AI workflows from the top 1% of developers\"\n- Strong value proposition (lines 8-62) with quantified benefits ($2.3M value, 156+ hours saved, 47 features shipped)\n- Badges for license and maintainer\n\n**Quality**: Exceeds requirements with a powerful narrative that clearly communicates project purpose and value.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 2. Installation/Setup Instructions\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Quick Start section (lines 78-101) with minimal setup steps\n- Comprehensive \"Installation & Setup\" section (lines 294-407)\n- Clear prerequisites (lines 298-313)\n- Recommended setup pattern with 3-step process (lines 315-382)\n- Update instructions (lines 66-74)\n- Team collaboration workflow explained (lines 349-365)\n\n**Quality**: Clear, actionable, with multiple approaches (quick start + detailed). Includes team workflow which is crucial for enterprise adoption.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. Usage Examples\n**Status**: GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- \"Usage Guide\" section (lines 409-460)\n- Two concrete examples:\n  - `/implement` command (lines 422-435)\n  - `/import-figma` command (lines 437-443)\n- Cross-reference to comprehensive guide for more examples (lines 447-458)\n\n**Quality**: Provides actionable examples but limited to 2 use cases in main README. However, cross-references to `docs/frontend.md` for detailed examples, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 4. Available Plugins\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- \"What's Inside\" section (lines 104-293)\n- Detailed descriptions for 5 plugins:\n  - Frontend Development (lines 110-156) - most detailed\n  - Code Analysis (lines 159-174)\n  - Bun Backend Development (lines 176-202)\n  - Orchestration (lines 205-238)\n  - Claudish CLI (lines 242-292)\n- Each includes: version, category, highlights, \"Perfect for\" use cases\n- Frontend plugin includes detailed workflow breakdown\n\n**Quality**: Very comprehensive with version numbers, feature highlights, and clear use case descriptions. Each plugin has enough detail to make an informed decision.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 5. Configuration\n**Status**: GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Settings format specified (lines 302-309)\n- Plugin enablement examples (lines 87-98, 331-340, 368-381)\n- Cross-reference to environment variables in technical docs (line 531 - DEPENDENCIES.md)\n- Team configuration mentioned (lines 359-365)\n\n**Quality**: Configuration is covered but environment variables are not detailed in the main README (they're in separate docs). For a professional project, having a brief \"Configuration\" section with common environment variables would be ideal.\n\n**Minor Gap**: No dedicated \"Configuration\" section consolidating all config options.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ 6. Contributing Guidelines\n**Status**: MISSING\n\n**Evidence**:\n- No \"Contributing\" section in main README\n- Reference to contributing docs exists (line 473: `./docs/contributing.md`)\n- No inline guidance on how to contribute (bug reports, feature requests, PRs)\n- Community requests mentioned (lines 506-507) but only for plugin ideas\n\n**Critical Gap**: While contributing docs are referenced, best practice is to have at least a brief \"Contributing\" section in the main README with:\n- How to report bugs\n- How to request features\n- Link to full contributing guide\n- Code of conduct (if applicable)\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 7. License\n**Status**: EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- License badge at top (line 5)\n- Dedicated \"License\" section (lines 536-540)\n- MIT License clearly stated\n- Note about individual plugin licenses\n\n**Quality**: Clear and complete.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 8. Requirements/Dependencies\n**Status**: GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- \"Prerequisites\" section (lines 298-313)\n- System requirements listed:\n  - Claude Code version requirements\n  - Plugin system requirements\n  - Git access\n- Cross-reference to detailed dependencies (line 531: DEPENDENCIES.md)\n\n**Quality**: Basic requirements covered. More detailed dependencies are in separate docs, which is acceptable for a high-level README.\n\n**Minor Gap**: No mention of Node.js, Chrome, or other system-level dependencies in main README (though they may be in linked docs).\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 9. Architecture Overview\n**Status**: GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- High-level architecture implicit in plugin descriptions\n- Cross-references to technical documentation (lines 478-534):\n  - TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md\n  - DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md\n  - COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md\n- Plugin structure described in installation section\n\n**Quality**: Architecture is covered through cross-references rather than inline explanation. For a marketplace project, this is acceptable as the architecture is primarily \"plugin-based system.\"\n\n**Minor Gap**: No diagram or visual representation of system architecture in main README.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ 10. Troubleshooting/FAQ\n**Status**: WEAK\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Brief troubleshooting mention in \"Verify Installation\" (lines 402-405)\n- Lists 3 common issues (plugin not showing, doctor errors, activation)\n- Cross-reference to troubleshooting docs (line 467: `./docs/troubleshooting.md`)\n\n**Critical Gap**: Only 3 bullet points for common issues. No FAQ section. While detailed troubleshooting is in separate docs, a README should have at least 5-10 common issues with quick solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Sections (Beyond Requirements)\n\n### ✅ Update Instructions\n- Clear update command (lines 66-74)\n- Important for maintenance\n\n### ✅ Roadmap\n- Current focus and future plans (lines 488-508)\n- Shows active development\n\n### ✅ Contact & Support\n- Multiple contact methods (lines 560-566)\n- Email, issues, discussions, website\n\n### ✅ Maintainers\n- Clear ownership (lines 544-548)\n\n### ✅ Acknowledgments\n- Credits to Claude Code and community (lines 552-556)\n\n---\n\n## Quality Assessment by Section\n\n| Section | Status | Quality Score (1-10) |\n|---------|--------|---------------------|\n| 1.
