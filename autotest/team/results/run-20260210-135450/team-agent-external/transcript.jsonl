The manifest is correctly formatted with all required fields, proper component references, and appropriate metadata. Minor discrepancies exist in skill count documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Core Required Fields ✅\\n\\n**All required fields present and correctly formatted:**\\n\\n- `name`: \\\"dev\\\" ✅ (short, descriptive)\\n- `version`: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✅ (semantic versioning)\\n- `description`: Comprehensive, includes version history and feature count ✅\\n- `author`: Complete object with name, email, company ✅\\n- `license`: \\\"MIT\\\" ✅\\n- `category`: \\\"development\\\" ✅\\n\\n**Comparison with other plugins:**\\n- Frontend plugin: Uses similar structure but simpler description\\n- Multimodel plugin: Adds `homepage`, `tags` (optional fields)\\n- Dev plugin: Matches established patterns\\n\\n### 2. Metadata Quality ✅\\n\\n**Description Field:**\\n```\\n\\\"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 45 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- Clear purpose statement\\n- Version changelog inline (good for users)\\n- Feature count mentioned\\n- Descriptive and informative\\n\\n**Minor Issue:**\\n- Claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but actual count is **46 skills** (verified by filesystem scan)\\n- All 46 skill directories have valid SKILL.md files\\n- This is a documentation accuracy issue, not a structural problem\\n\\n**Keywords Array:**\\n- 42 keywords covering broad range: languages, frameworks, practices\\n- Well-organized: general → specific → technology stack\\n- Appropriate for discovery and search\\n\\n### 3. Component References ✅\\n\\n**Agents:** 15 agent files listed\\n- All paths use relative `./agents/*.md` format ✅\\n- Verified: 16 agent files exist on disk\\n- Listed: 15 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** One agent file not listed (test-architect.md)\\n\\n**Commands:** 12 command files listed\\n- All paths use relative `./commands/*.md` format ✅\\n- Verified: 13 command files exist on disk\\n- Listed: 12 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** `/dev:delegate` command exists on disk but NOT listed\\n- This is a **significant omission** - the delegate command is functional but not exposed\\n\\n**Skills:** 44 skill paths listed\\n- Mix of directory paths (e.g., `./skills/context-detection`) and nested paths ✅\\n- Verified: 46 skill directories exist on disk\\n- Listed: 44 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** 2 skill directories:\\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review` (exists on disk)\\n  - One other skill path\\n\\n**MCP Servers:**\\n```json\\n\\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"\\n```\\n- Reference is correct ✅\\n- File exists at `plugins/dev/.mcp.json` ✅\\n- Contains valid claudish MCP server config ✅\\n\\n**Output Styles:**\\n```json\\n\\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\n  \\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n- Unique to dev plugin (not seen in frontend/multimodel) ✅\\n- Valid optional field ✅\\n\\n### 4. Dependency Management ✅\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- Correctly declares dependency on multimodel plugin ✅\\n- Uses semantic versioning with caret range (^2.0.0) ✅\\n- Matches marketplace naming convention ✅\\n- Appropriate: dev plugin uses PROXY_MODE which is a multimodel feature ✅\\n\\n### 5. Compatibility Declaration ✅\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n  \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- Standard format matching other plugins ✅\\n- Broad compatibility range (appropriate for stable plugin) ✅\\n\\n### 6. JSON Schema Correctness ✅\\n\\n**Validation:**\\n- Valid JSON syntax ✅\\n- Proper nesting and structure ✅\\n- Consistent formatting (2-space indentation) ✅\\n- No trailing commas ✅\\n- All string values properly quoted ✅\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison with Best Practices\\n\\n### Best Practices from Frontend Plugin:\\n1. ✅ Clean, single-line description with version history\\n2. ✅ Complete author information\\n3. ✅ Keywords for discoverability\\n4. ✅ Relative paths for all components\\n5. ✅ MCP server configuration externalized\\n\\n### Best Practices from Multimodel Plugin:\\n1. ✅ Comprehensive description with changelog\\n2. ❌ Optional `homepage` field not used (acceptable)\\n3. ❌ Optional `tags` field not used, uses `keywords` instead (acceptable)\\n4. ❌ Optional `skillBundles` not used (acceptable for this plugin)\\n5. ✅ Dependencies declared\\n\\n### Unique Features:\\n1. ✅ `outputStyles` field (custom output formatting)\\n2. ✅ Extensive skill library (46 skills)\\n3. ✅ Large agent pool (16 agents)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### Critical Issues\\n**NONE**\\n\\n### High Priority Issues\\n1. **Missing command in manifest**: `/dev:delegate` command exists on disk but not listed in `commands` array\\n   - Impact: Command may not be properly registered/discoverable\\n   - Location: `plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md` exists, not in plugin.json line 62-75\\n   - Recommendation: Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n\\n### Medium Priority Issues\\n2. **Skill count mismatch**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\", actual count is 46\\n   - Impact: Minor documentation accuracy issue\\n   - Location: Line 4 description field\\n   - Recommendation: Update to \\\"46 skills\\\" for accuracy\\n\\n3. **Missing skills in manifest**: At least 2 skill directories exist but not listed\\n   - Impact: Skills may not be loaded/available\\n   - One confirmed: `./skills/design/ui-design-review`\\n   - Recommendation: Audit skills array against filesystem and add missing entries\\n\\n### Low Priority Issues\\n4. **Missing agent in manifest**: `test-architect.md` exists but not listed\\n   - Impact: Agent not available for Task tool delegation\\n   - Location: File exists at `plugins/dev/agents/test-architect.md`\\n   - Recommendation: Add to agents array if intended for use\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive coverage**: 15 agents, 12 commands, 44 skills\\n2. **Well-organized structure**: Clear separation of concerns\\n3. **Proper dependency management**: Declares multimodel dependency\\n4. **Rich metadata**: 42 keywords, detailed description\\n5. **MCP integration**: Proper claudish MCP server configuration\\n6. **Follows conventions**: Matches patterns from other MAG plugins\\n7. **Output customization**: Uses outputStyles feature\\n8. **JSON quality**: Perfect syntax, formatting, and structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions (v1.29.1 patch):\\n1. Add missing `/dev:delegate` command to commands array\\n2. Update skill count in description from \\\"45\\\" to \\\"46\\\"\\n3. Audit and add missing skills (`ui-design-review`, `task-routing` if missing)\\n4. Add `test-architect.md` to agents array if functional\\n\\n### Future Enhancements:\\n1. Consider adding `homepage` field linking to repository\\n2. Consider using `skillBundles` to organize 46 skills into logical groups\\n3. Document purpose of `outputStyles/self-improving.md` in README\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Evidence\\n\\n**Filesystem Counts:**\\n- Agents on disk: 16 files\\n- Agents in manifest: 15 listed\\n- Commands on disk: 13 files\\n- Commands in manifest: 12 listed\\n- Skills on disk: 46 directories with SKILL.md\\n- Skills in manifest: 44 listed\\n\\n**File Existence Checks:**\\n- ✅ `.mcp.json` exists and is valid\\n- ✅ All listed agent files exist\\n- ✅ All listed command files exist\\n- ✅ All listed skill directories exist\\n- ❌ `delegate.md` command exists but not listed\\n- ❌ Some skill directories exist but not listed\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound and follows Claude Code best practices**. The manifest is well-formed, comprehensive, and properly declares dependencies and compatibility.\\n\\nThe primary issue is **component reference completeness** - several files exist on disk but are not listed in the manifest. This suggests the plugin may have been actively developed with new components added but the manifest not fully updated.\\n\\nThese are **maintenance issues, not structural defects**. The plugin.json format is correct and would function properly with the listed components. However, missing components may cause confusion or reduce plugin functionality.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** APPROVE with minor maintenance required (add missing command/skills in next patch release).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: APPROVE\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Well-structured manifest following best practices, but missing delegate command and 2-3 skills from component arrays (maintenance issue, not structural defect)\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing /dev:delegate command in manifest, skill count mismatch (claims 45 has 46), 2-3 skills not listed, test-architect.md agent not listed\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":414,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":25713,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":414,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXydzSggfKqirdgmNoYf8\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.643Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.647Z\",\"uuid\":\"67a78fab-d8ec-4b24-b20c-c053ef0eac99\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67a78fab-d8ec-4b24-b20c-c053ef0eac99\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.647Z\",\"uuid\":\"7bc398dd-f070-46cb-8a6d-efe971e6ab6a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-135726-4a37389e/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"2ef97f05-9a4e-4a12-b8d3-ea183eb7c4e0\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.646Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\"}\n</output>"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0","uuid":"46d829ad-602e-49eb-9281-0288f11132b1","tool_use_result":{"retrieval_status":"success","task":{"task_id":"a306323","task_type":"local_agent","status":"completed","description":"Grok vote on dev plugin.json","output":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\\n\\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

The manifest is correctly formatted with all required fields, proper component references, and appropriate metadata. Minor discrepancies exist in skill count documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Core Required Fields ✅\\n\\n**All required fields present and correctly formatted:**\\n\\n- `name`: \\\"dev\\\" ✅ (short, descriptive)\\n- `version`: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✅ (semantic versioning)\\n- `description`: Comprehensive, includes version history and feature count ✅\\n- `author`: Complete object with name, email, company ✅\\n- `license`: \\\"MIT\\\" ✅\\n- `category`: \\\"development\\\" ✅\\n\\n**Comparison with other plugins:**\\n- Frontend plugin: Uses similar structure but simpler description\\n- Multimodel plugin: Adds `homepage`, `tags` (optional fields)\\n- Dev plugin: Matches established patterns\\n\\n### 2. Metadata Quality ✅\\n\\n**Description Field:**\\n```\\n\\\"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 45 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- Clear purpose statement\\n- Version changelog inline (good for users)\\n- Feature count mentioned\\n- Descriptive and informative\\n\\n**Minor Issue:**\\n- Claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but actual count is **46 skills** (verified by filesystem scan)\\n- All 46 skill directories have valid SKILL.md files\\n- This is a documentation accuracy issue, not a structural problem\\n\\n**Keywords Array:**\\n- 42 keywords covering broad range: languages, frameworks, practices\\n- Well-organized: general → specific → technology stack\\n- Appropriate for discovery and search\\n\\n### 3. Component References ✅\\n\\n**Agents:** 15 agent files listed\\n- All paths use relative `./agents/*.md` format ✅\\n- Verified: 16 agent files exist on disk\\n- Listed: 15 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** One agent file not listed (test-architect.md)\\n\\n**Commands:** 12 command files listed\\n- All paths use relative `./commands/*.md` format ✅\\n- Verified: 13 command files exist on disk\\n- Listed: 12 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** `/dev:delegate` command exists on disk but NOT listed\\n- This is a **significant omission** - the delegate command is functional but not exposed\\n\\n**Skills:** 44 skill paths listed\\n- Mix of directory paths (e.g., `./skills/context-detection`) and nested paths ✅\\n- Verified: 46 skill directories exist on disk\\n- Listed: 44 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** 2 skill directories:\\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review` (exists on disk)\\n  - One other skill path\\n\\n**MCP Servers:**\\n```json\\n\\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"\\n```\\n- Reference is correct ✅\\n- File exists at `plugins/dev/.mcp.json` ✅\\n- Contains valid claudish MCP server config ✅\\n\\n**Output Styles:**\\n```json\\n\\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\n  \\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n- Unique to dev plugin (not seen in frontend/multimodel) ✅\\n- Valid optional field ✅\\n\\n### 4.

Add missing `/dev:delegate` command to commands array\\n2. Update skill count in description from \\\"45\\\" to \\\"46\\\"\\n3. Audit and add missing skills (`ui-design-review`, `task-routing` if missing)\\n4. Add `test-architect.md` to agents array if functional\\n\\n### Future Enhancements:\\n1. Consider adding `homepage` field linking to repository\\n2. Consider using `skillBundles` to organize 46 skills into logical groups\\n3. Document purpose of `outputStyles/self-improving.md` in README\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Evidence\\n\\n**Filesystem Counts:**\\n- Agents on disk: 16 files\\n- Agents in manifest: 15 listed\\n- Commands on disk: 13 files\\n- Commands in manifest: 12 listed\\n- Skills on disk: 46 directories with SKILL.md\\n- Skills in manifest: 44 listed\\n\\n**File Existence Checks:**\\n- ✅ `.mcp.json` exists and is valid\\n- ✅ All listed agent files exist\\n- ✅ All listed command files exist\\n- ✅ All listed skill directories exist\\n- ❌ `delegate.md` command exists but not listed\\n- ❌ Some skill directories exist but not listed\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound and follows Claude Code best practices**. The manifest is well-formed, comprehensive, and properly declares dependencies and compatibility.\\n\\nThe primary issue is **component reference completeness** - several files exist on disk but are not listed in the manifest. This suggests the plugin may have been actively developed with new components added but the manifest not fully updated.\\n\\nThese are **maintenance issues, not structural defects**. The plugin.json format is correct and would function properly with the listed components. However, missing components may cause confusion or reduce plugin functionality.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** APPROVE with minor maintenance required (add missing command/skills in next patch release).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: APPROVE\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Well-structured manifest following best practices, but missing delegate command and 2-3 skills from component arrays (maintenance issue, not structural defect)\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing /dev:delegate command in manifest, skill count mismatch (claims 45 has 46), 2-3 skills not listed, test-architect.md agent not listed\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":414,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":25713,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":414,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXydzSggfKqirdgmNoYf8\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.643Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.647Z\",\"uuid\":\"67a78fab-d8ec-4b24-b20c-c053ef0eac99\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67a78fab-d8ec-4b24-b20c-c053ef0eac99\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.647Z\",\"uuid\":\"7bc398dd-f070-46cb-8a6d-efe971e6ab6a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"e3d3cba5-08c6-44fd-84d6-dbb4f1121db0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a306323\",\"slug\":\"purring-singing-snowglobe\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_011kzxLce23F64zkyZs4EESA\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-135726-4a37389e/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"2ef97f05-9a4e-4a12-b8d3-ea183eb7c4e0\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T02:59:00.646Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"7bcdbab3-a510-4fea-a818-04cc634a6484\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

The manifest is correctly formatted with all required fields, proper component references, and appropriate metadata. Minor discrepancies exist in skill count documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Core Required Fields ✅\\n\\n**All required fields present and correctly formatted:**\\n\\n- `name`: \\\"dev\\\" ✅ (short, descriptive)\\n- `version`: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✅ (semantic versioning)\\n- `description`: Comprehensive, includes version history and feature count ✅\\n- `author`: Complete object with name, email, company ✅\\n- `license`: \\\"MIT\\\" ✅\\n- `category`: \\\"development\\\" ✅\\n\\n**Comparison with other plugins:**\\n- Frontend plugin: Uses similar structure but simpler description\\n- Multimodel plugin: Adds `homepage`, `tags` (optional fields)\\n- Dev plugin: Matches established patterns\\n\\n### 2. Metadata Quality ✅\\n\\n**Description Field:**\\n```\\n\\\"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 45 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- Clear purpose statement\\n- Version changelog inline (good for users)\\n- Feature count mentioned\\n- Descriptive and informative\\n\\n**Minor Issue:**\\n- Claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but actual count is **46 skills** (verified by filesystem scan)\\n- All 46 skill directories have valid SKILL.md files\\n- This is a documentation accuracy issue, not a structural problem\\n\\n**Keywords Array:**\\n- 42 keywords covering broad range: languages, frameworks, practices\\n- Well-organized: general → specific → technology stack\\n- Appropriate for discovery and search\\n\\n### 3. Component References ✅\\n\\n**Agents:** 15 agent files listed\\n- All paths use relative `./agents/*.md` format ✅\\n- Verified: 16 agent files exist on disk\\n- Listed: 15 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** One agent file not listed (test-architect.md)\\n\\n**Commands:** 12 command files listed\\n- All paths use relative `./commands/*.md` format ✅\\n- Verified: 13 command files exist on disk\\n- Listed: 12 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** `/dev:delegate` command exists on disk but NOT listed\\n- This is a **significant omission** - the delegate command is functional but not exposed\\n\\n**Skills:** 44 skill paths listed\\n- Mix of directory paths (e.g., `./skills/context-detection`) and nested paths ✅\\n- Verified: 46 skill directories exist on disk\\n- Listed: 44 in plugin.json\\n- **Missing from manifest:** 2 skill directories:\\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review` (exists on disk)\\n  - One other skill path\\n\\n**MCP Servers:**\\n```json\\n\\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"\\n```\\n- Reference is correct ✅\\n- File exists at `plugins/dev/.mcp.json` ✅\\n- Contains valid claudish MCP server config ✅\\n\\n**Output Styles:**\\n```json\\n\\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\n  \\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n- Unique to dev plugin (not seen in frontend/multimodel) ✅\\n- Valid optional field ✅\\n\\n### 4.

Metadata Quality ✅\n\n**Description Field:**\n```\n\"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 45 skills.\"\n```\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear purpose statement\n- Version changelog inline (good for users)\n- Feature count mentioned\n- Descriptive and informative\n\n**Minor Issue:**\n- Claims \"45 skills\" but actual count is **46 skills** (verified by filesystem scan)\n- All 46 skill directories have valid SKILL.md files\n- This is a documentation accuracy issue, not a structural problem\n\n**Keywords Array:**\n- 42 keywords covering broad range: languages, frameworks, practices\n- Well-organized: general → specific → technology stack\n- Appropriate for discovery and search\n\n### 3. Component References ✅\n\n**Agents:** 15 agent files listed\n- All paths use relative `./agents/*.md` format ✅\n- Verified: 16 agent files exist on disk\n- Listed: 15 in plugin.json\n- **Missing from manifest:** One agent file not listed (test-architect.md)\n\n**Commands:** 12 command files listed\n- All paths use relative `./commands/*.md` format ✅\n- Verified: 13 command files exist on disk\n- Listed: 12 in plugin.json\n- **Missing from manifest:** `/dev:delegate` command exists on disk but NOT listed\n- This is a **significant omission** - the delegate command is functional but not exposed\n\n**Skills:** 44 skill paths listed\n- Mix of directory paths (e.g., `./skills/context-detection`) and nested paths ✅\n- Verified: 46 skill directories exist on disk\n- Listed: 44 in plugin.json\n- **Missing from manifest:** 2 skill directories:\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review` (exists on disk)\n  - One other skill path\n\n**MCP Servers:**\n```json\n\"mcpServers\": \"./.mcp.json\"\n```\n- Reference is correct ✅\n- File exists at `plugins/dev/.mcp.json` ✅\n- Contains valid claudish MCP server config ✅\n\n**Output Styles:**\n```json\n\"outputStyles\": [\n  \"./output-styles/self-improving.md\"\n]\n```\n- Unique to dev plugin (not seen in frontend/multimodel) ✅\n- Valid optional field ✅\n\n### 4. Dependency Management ✅\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\": \"^2.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Correctly declares dependency on multimodel plugin ✅\n- Uses semantic versioning with caret range (^2.0.0) ✅\n- Matches marketplace naming convention ✅\n- Appropriate: dev plugin uses PROXY_MODE which is a multimodel feature ✅\n\n### 5. Compatibility Declaration ✅\n\n```json\n\"compatibility\": {\n  \"claudeCode\": \">=0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Standard format matching other plugins ✅\n- Broad compatibility range (appropriate for stable plugin) ✅\n\n### 6. JSON Schema Correctness ✅\n\n**Validation:**\n- Valid JSON syntax ✅\n- Proper nesting and structure ✅\n- Consistent formatting (2-space indentation) ✅\n- No trailing commas ✅\n- All string values properly quoted ✅\n\n---\n\n## Comparison with Best Practices\n\n### Best Practices from Frontend Plugin:\n1. ✅ Clean, single-line description with version history\n2. ✅ Complete author information\n3. ✅ Keywords for discoverability\n4. ✅ Relative paths for all components\n5. ✅ MCP server configuration externalized\n\n### Best Practices from Multimodel Plugin:\n1. ✅ Comprehensive description with changelog\n2. ❌ Optional `homepage` field not used (acceptable)\n3. ❌ Optional `tags` field not used, uses `keywords` instead (acceptable)\n4. ❌ Optional `skillBundles` not used (acceptable for this plugin)\n5. ✅ Dependencies declared\n\n### Unique Features:\n1. ✅ `outputStyles` field (custom output formatting)\n2. ✅ Extensive skill library (46 skills)\n3. ✅ Large agent pool (16 agents)\n\n---\n\n## Issues Identified\n\n### Critical Issues\n**NONE**\n\n### High Priority Issues\n1. **Missing command in manifest**: `/dev:delegate` command exists on disk but not listed in `commands` array\n   - Impact: Command may not be properly registered/discoverable\n   - Location: `plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md` exists, not in plugin.json line 62-75\n   - Recommendation: Add `\"./commands/delegate.md\"` to commands array\n\n### Medium Priority Issues\n2. **Skill count mismatch**: Description claims \"45 skills\", actual count is 46\n   - Impact: Minor documentation accuracy issue\n   - Location: Line 4 description field\n   - Recommendation: Update to \"46 skills\" for accuracy\n\n3. **Missing skills in manifest**: At least 2 skill directories exist but not listed\n   - Impact: Skills may not be loaded/available\n   - One confirmed: `./skills/design/ui-design-review`\n   - Recommendation: Audit skills array against filesystem and add missing entries\n\n### Low Priority Issues\n4. **Missing agent in manifest**: `test-architect.md` exists but not listed\n   - Impact: Agent not available for Task tool delegation\n   - Location: File exists at `plugins/dev/agents/test-architect.md`\n   - Recommendation: Add to agents array if intended for use\n\n---\n\n## Strengths\n\n1. **Comprehensive coverage**: 15 agents, 12 commands, 44 skills\n2. **Well-organized structure**: Clear separation of concerns\n3. **Proper dependency management**: Declares multimodel dependency\n4. **Rich metadata**: 42 keywords, detailed description\n5. **MCP integration**: Proper claudish MCP server configuration\n6. **Follows conventions**: Matches patterns from other MAG plugins\n7. **Output customization**: Uses outputStyles feature\n8. **JSON quality**: Perfect syntax, formatting, and structure\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (v1.29.1 patch):\n1. Add missing `/dev:delegate` command to commands array\n2. Update skill count in description from \"45\" to \"46\"\n3. Audit and add missing skills (`ui-design-review`, `task-routing` if missing)\n4. Add `test-architect.md` to agents array if functional\n\n### Future Enhancements:\n1. Consider adding `homepage` field linking to repository\n2. Consider using `skillBundles` to organize 46 skills into logical groups\n3. Document purpose of `outputStyles/self-improving.md` in README\n\n---\n\n## Verification Evidence\n\n**Filesystem Counts:**\n- Agents on disk: 16 files\n- Agents in manifest: 15 listed\n- Commands on disk: 13 files\n- Commands in manifest: 12 listed\n- Skills on disk: 46 directories with SKILL.md\n- Skills in manifest: 44 listed\n\n**File Existence Checks:**\n- ✅ `.mcp.json` exists and is valid\n- ✅ All listed agent files exist\n- ✅ All listed command files exist\n- ✅ All listed skill directories exist\n- ❌ `delegate.md` command exists but not listed\n- ❌ Some skill directories exist but not listed\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound and follows Claude Code best practices**. The manifest is well-formed, comprehensive, and properly declares dependencies and compatibility.\n\nThe primary issue is **component reference completeness** - several files exist on disk but are not listed in the manifest. This suggests the plugin may have been actively developed with new components added but the manifest not fully updated.\n\nThese are **maintenance issues, not structural defects**. The plugin.json format is correct and would function properly with the listed components. However, missing components may cause confusion or reduce plugin functionality.\n\n**Recommendation:** APPROVE with minor maintenance required (add missing command/skills in next patch release).\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: APPROVE\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nSUMMARY: Well-structured manifest following best practices, but missing delegate command and 2-3 skills from component arrays (maintenance issue, not structural defect)\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing /dev:delegate command in manifest, skill count mismatch (claims 45 has 46), 2-3 skills not listed, test-architect.md agent not listed\n```\n","numLines":252,"startLine":1,"totalLines":252}}}
