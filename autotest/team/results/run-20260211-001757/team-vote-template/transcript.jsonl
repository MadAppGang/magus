Professional open-source projects universally include a prominent Contributing section to encourage community participation.\\n\\nThe README has 95% of what's needed, but the 5% that's missing significantly impacts the project's ability to attract contributors. This is fixable with a simple addition of ~10 lines.\\n\\n**Confidence: 8/10** - The evaluation is clear and evidence-based, with specific line numbers cited.

Professional open-source projects universally include a prominent Contributing section to encourage community participation.\\n\\nThe README has 95% of what's needed, but the 5% that's missing significantly impacts the project's ability to attract contributors. This is fixable with a simple addition of ~10 lines.\\n\\n**Confidence: 8/10** - The evaluation is clear and evidence-based, with specific line numbers cited. The only uncertainty is whether the project's maintainers consider contributing guidelines less important for their use case (though this would be unusual for an open-source marketplace).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Analysis Complete**\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8121,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":19076,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8121,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXzURS6WAe12vTpqW7efP\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.594Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"599628db-0346-41ee-bd7b-067c1a6a0dcb\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aaae01c\",\"slug\":\"snug-meandering-anchor\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.598Z\",\"uuid\":\"1f669bae-8c4b-4a0c-ae0b-706f62335f69\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"1f669bae-8c4b-4a0c-ae0b-706f62335f69\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"599628db-0346-41ee-bd7b-067c1a6a0dcb\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aaae01c\",\"slug\":\"snug-meandering-anchor\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.598Z\",\"uuid\":\"25468a13-076e-48aa-bdd6-bcf029cc2f11\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"599628db-0346-41ee-bd7b-067c1a6a0dcb\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aaae01c\",\"slug\":\"snug-meandering-anchor\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-evaluate-readme-sect-20260211-003252-bab6691e/internal-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"6cb883d1-2624-4643-9040-0cd67a2e2f88\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.597Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\"}\n","prompt":"## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nEvaluate if the README has all required sections.

Professional open-source projects universally include a prominent Contributing section to encourage community participation.\\n\\nThe README has 95% of what's needed, but the 5% that's missing significantly impacts the project's ability to attract contributors. This is fixable with a simple addition of ~10 lines.\\n\\n**Confidence: 8/10** - The evaluation is clear and evidence-based, with specific line numbers cited. The only uncertainty is whether the project's maintainers consider contributing guidelines less important for their use case (though this would be unusual for an open-source marketplace).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Analysis Complete**\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8121,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":19076,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8121,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXzURS6WAe12vTpqW7efP\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.594Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"599628db-0346-41ee-bd7b-067c1a6a0dcb\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aaae01c\",\"slug\":\"snug-meandering-anchor\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.598Z\",\"uuid\":\"1f669bae-8c4b-4a0c-ae0b-706f62335f69\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"1f669bae-8c4b-4a0c-ae0b-706f62335f69\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"599628db-0346-41ee-bd7b-067c1a6a0dcb\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aaae01c\",\"slug\":\"snug-meandering-anchor\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.598Z\",\"uuid\":\"25468a13-076e-48aa-bdd6-bcf029cc2f11\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"599628db-0346-41ee-bd7b-067c1a6a0dcb\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aaae01c\",\"slug\":\"snug-meandering-anchor\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01DFdK1La1pCE4iEfeEsSUSB\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-evaluate-readme-sect-20260211-003252-bab6691e/internal-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"6cb883d1-2624-4643-9040-0cd67a2e2f88\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:33:54.597Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"b139d6fd-1df3-4ab7-899f-add02d6e6d43\"}\n"}}}
