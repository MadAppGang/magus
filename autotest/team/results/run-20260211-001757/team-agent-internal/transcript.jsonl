After comparing with 4 other plugins in the repository (frontend, code-analysis, multimodel, bun), the manifest demonstrates consistency with established patterns and includes all required fields.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Strengths\\n\\n1. **Complete Required Fields**\\n   - All mandatory fields present: `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`\\n   - Version matches marketplace.json entry (1.30.0) ✅\\n   - Proper semantic versioning\\n\\n2. **Consistent Author Information**\\n   - Matches pattern used across all plugins:\\n     ```json\\n     \\\"author\\\": {\\n       \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n       \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n       \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Component Declarations**\\n   - **15 agents** declared (vs 11 in frontend, 1 in code-analysis)\\n   - **14 commands** declared (vs 8 in frontend, 3 in code-analysis)\\n   - **40+ skills** declared (largest skill collection in the repository)\\n   - **1 output style** declared (self-improving.md)\\n   - All paths use correct relative format (`./agents/`, `./commands/`, `./skills/`)\\n\\n4. **MCP Server Configuration**\\n   - Uses `./.mcp.json` pattern (consistent with code-analysis plugin)\\n   - External file approach allows dynamic configuration\\n\\n5. **Dependency Management**\\n   - Declares dependency on `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0`\\n   - Uses proper namespace format `plugin@marketplace`\\n   - Semantic version constraint (^2.0.0) is appropriate\\n\\n6. **Compatibility Declaration**\\n   - `\\\"compatibility\\\": { \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\" }`\\n   - Matches pattern used in multimodel and code-analysis plugins\\n\\n7. **Keyword Richness**\\n   - 41 keywords covering broad tech stack\\n   - Includes language-specific keywords: react, typescript, golang, bun, python, rust\\n   - Includes domain keywords: orchestration, ui-design, LLMREI, multimodal\\n\\n8. **Category Classification**\\n   - `\\\"category\\\": \\\"development\\\"` - appropriate and consistent with frontend, code-analysis, bun\\n\\n### ⚠️ Minor Observations (Not Issues)\\n\\n1. **Field Naming Consistency**\\n   - Dev plugin uses `\\\"keywords\\\"` (array)\\n   - Multimodel plugin uses `\\\"tags\\\"` (array)\\n   - Both are valid, but inconsistent naming across repository\\n   - **Impact**: None - both work correctly\\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider standardizing on `keywords` (matches marketplace.json and most plugins)\\n\\n2. **Missing Optional Fields** (Compared to multimodel plugin)\\n   - No `\\\"homepage\\\"` field (multimodel has it)\\n   - No `\\\"skillBundles\\\"` (multimodel has organized skill groups)\\n   - **Impact**: None - these are optional features\\n   - **Note**: skillBundles could help organize 40+ skills\\n\\n3. **No Hooks Declaration**\\n   - Code-analysis and multimodel have `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n   - Dev plugin has no hooks\\n   - **Impact**: None - hooks are optional\\n\\n### ✅ Validation Against Repository Conventions\\n\\nChecked against patterns in 4 other plugins:\\n\\n| Convention | Dev Plugin | Status |\\n|------------|-----------|--------|\\n| Name format | ✅ lowercase, no special chars | ✅ |\\n| Version format | ✅ semantic versioning | ✅ |\\n| Author structure | ✅ name, email, company | ✅ |\\n| License field | ✅ \\\"MIT\\\" | ✅ |\\n| Category field | ✅ \\\"development\\\" | ✅ |\\n| Component paths | ✅ relative with `./` prefix | ✅ |\\n| MCP config | ✅ external .mcp.json file | ✅ |\\n| Dependencies | ✅ namespace@marketplace format | ✅ |\\n| Compatibility | ✅ claudeCode version constraint | ✅ |\\n| Marketplace sync | ✅ version 1.30.0 matches | ✅ |\\n\\n### ✅ Best Practices Compliance\\n\\n1. **Descriptive version notes in description** - ✅ \\\"v1.30.0: Added <critical_override> blocks...\\\"\\n2. **Clear capability summary** - ✅ \\\"45 skills\\\" helps users understand scope\\n3. **Technology stack keywords** - ✅ Comprehensive coverage\\n4. **Dependency declaration** - ✅ Explicit multimodel requirement\\n5. **Relative paths** - ✅ All component paths use `./` prefix for portability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison Summary\\n\\n| Metric | Dev | Frontend | Code-Analysis | Multimodel | Bun |\\n|--------|-----|----------|---------------|------------|-----|\\n| Agents | 15 | 11 | 1 | 0 | 3 |\\n| Commands | 14 | 8 | 3 | 1 | 4 |\\n| Skills | 40+ | 13 | 12 | 14 | 1 |\\n| Keywords | 41 | 10 | 13 | 18 | 13 |\\n| Dependencies | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| Has Hooks | No | No | Yes | Yes | No |\\n| Has Homepage | No | No | No | Yes | No |\\n\\n**Observation**: Dev plugin is the most comprehensive in terms of components (agents, commands, skills).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Potential Improvements (Optional)\\n\\nThese are **not issues** - the plugin.json is fully functional. These are suggestions for future enhancement:\\n\\n1. **Skill Bundles** (like multimodel plugin)\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n     \\\"frontend\\\": [\\\"context-detection\\\", \\\"frontend/react-typescript\\\", \\\"frontend/vue-typescript\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"backend\\\": [\\\"backend/api-design\\\", \\\"backend/golang\\\", \\\"backend/bunjs\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"core\\\": [\\\"core/universal-patterns\\\", \\\"core/testing-strategies\\\", ...]\\n   }\\n   ```\\n   - Would help users discover relevant skills by domain\\n   - Optional feature, not required\\n\\n2. **Homepage URL**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code\\\"\\n   ```\\n   - Provides direct link to documentation\\n   - Multimodel plugin has this\\n\\n3. **Standardize `keywords` vs `tags`**\\n   - Dev uses `keywords` (matches marketplace.json)\\n   - Multimodel uses `tags`\\n   - Consider making multimodel consistent\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Found\\n\\n**None**. The plugin.json is well-formed and follows all conventions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **exemplary**. It:\\n- ✅ Includes all required fields\\n- ✅ Follows Claude Code plugin system conventions\\n- ✅ Maintains consistency with other plugins in the repository\\n- ✅ Properly declares dependencies\\n- ✅ Syncs with marketplace.json (version 1.30.0 matches)\\n- ✅ Uses appropriate semantic versioning\\n- ✅ Provides comprehensive metadata (41 keywords, clear description)\\n\\nThe manifest is production-ready and requires no changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: APPROVE\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: Plugin.json is exemplary - all required fields present, follows conventions perfectly, syncs with marketplace.\\nKEY_ISSUES: None\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":3060,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":24274,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":3060,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXzTK2665Yxuo6Wmkwguy\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"ee31b918-0f0b-4c61-a7b4-a78391ac93e8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:19:19.368Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"ee31b918-0f0b-4c61-a7b4-a78391ac93e8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"6ec6e0bb-d1fb-42c5-b81e-faec480361d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aa2f8bd\",\"slug\":\"validated-fluttering-rose\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01W5r3WSGpTjSxFh61bXVE6R\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01W5r3WSGpTjSxFh61bXVE6R\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:19:19.371Z\",\"uuid\":\"ac242805-0700-4ffc-b533-c324d6b249d6\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"ac242805-0700-4ffc-b533-c324d6b249d6\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"6ec6e0bb-d1fb-42c5-b81e-faec480361d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aa2f8bd\",\"slug\":\"validated-fluttering-rose\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01W5r3WSGpTjSxFh61bXVE6R\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01W5r3WSGpTjSxFh61bXVE6R\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:19:19.371Z\",\"uuid\":\"8b639b3f-055a-4a99-a784-d99f33f7e72d\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"ee31b918-0f0b-4c61-a7b4-a78391ac93e8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"6ec6e0bb-d1fb-42c5-b81e-faec480361d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aa2f8bd\",\"slug\":\"validated-fluttering-rose\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01W5r3WSGpTjSxFh61bXVE6R\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260211-001814-4dba9d34/internal-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"1d23c14c-2ded-41bf-b977-d9af5b2da0a0\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T13:19:19.371Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"ee31b918-0f0b-4c61-a7b4-a78391ac93e8\"}\n</output>"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6ec6e0bb-d1fb-42c5-b81e-faec480361d0","uuid":"a1443028-78a5-4d31-a37d-fe0742152f67","tool_use_result":{"retrieval_status":"success","task":{"task_id":"aa2f8bd","task_type":"local_agent","status":"completed","description":"Internal Claude vote","output":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"6ec6e0bb-d1fb-42c5-b81e-faec480361d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"aa2f8bd\",\"slug\":\"validated-fluttering-rose\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

After comparing with 4 other plugins in the repository (frontend, code-analysis, multimodel, bun), the manifest demonstrates consistency with established patterns and includes all required fields.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Strengths\\n\\n1. **Complete Required Fields**\\n   - All mandatory fields present: `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`\\n   - Version matches marketplace.json entry (1.30.0) ✅\\n   - Proper semantic versioning\\n\\n2. **Consistent Author Information**\\n   - Matches pattern used across all plugins:\\n     ```json\\n     \\\"author\\\": {\\n       \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n       \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n       \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Component Declarations**\\n   - **15 agents** declared (vs 11 in frontend, 1 in code-analysis)\\n   - **14 commands** declared (vs 8 in frontend, 3 in code-analysis)\\n   - **40+ skills** declared (largest skill collection in the repository)\\n   - **1 output style** declared (self-improving.md)\\n   - All paths use correct relative format (`./agents/`, `./commands/`, `./skills/`)\\n\\n4. **MCP Server Configuration**\\n   - Uses `./.mcp.json` pattern (consistent with code-analysis plugin)\\n   - External file approach allows dynamic configuration\\n\\n5. **Dependency Management**\\n   - Declares dependency on `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0`\\n   - Uses proper namespace format `plugin@marketplace`\\n   - Semantic version constraint (^2.0.0) is appropriate\\n\\n6. **Compatibility Declaration**\\n   - `\\\"compatibility\\\": { \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\" }`\\n   - Matches pattern used in multimodel and code-analysis plugins\\n\\n7. **Keyword Richness**\\n   - 41 keywords covering broad tech stack\\n   - Includes language-specific keywords: react, typescript, golang, bun, python, rust\\n   - Includes domain keywords: orchestration, ui-design, LLMREI, multimodal\\n\\n8. **Category Classification**\\n   - `\\\"category\\\": \\\"development\\\"` - appropriate and consistent with frontend, code-analysis, bun\\n\\n### ⚠️ Minor Observations (Not Issues)\\n\\n1. **Field Naming Consistency**\\n   - Dev plugin uses `\\\"keywords\\\"` (array)\\n   - Multimodel plugin uses `\\\"tags\\\"` (array)\\n   - Both are valid, but inconsistent naming across repository\\n   - **Impact**: None - both work correctly\\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider standardizing on `keywords` (matches marketplace.json and most plugins)\\n\\n2. **Missing Optional Fields** (Compared to multimodel plugin)\\n   - No `\\\"homepage\\\"` field (multimodel has it)\\n   - No `\\\"skillBundles\\\"` (multimodel has organized skill groups)\\n   - **Impact**: None - these are optional features\\n   - **Note**: skillBundles could help organize 40+ skills\\n\\n3. **No Hooks Declaration**\\n   - Code-analysis and multimodel have `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n   - Dev plugin has no hooks\\n   - **Impact**: None - hooks are optional\\n\\n### ✅ Validation Against Repository Conventions\\n\\nChecked against patterns in 4 other plugins:\\n\\n| Convention | Dev Plugin | Status |\\n|------------|-----------|--------|\\n| Name format | ✅ lowercase, no special chars | ✅ |\\n| Version format | ✅ semantic versioning | ✅ |\\n| Author structure | ✅ name, email, company | ✅ |\\n| License field | ✅ \\\"MIT\\\" | ✅ |\\n| Category field | ✅ \\\"development\\\" | ✅ |\\n| Component paths | ✅ relative with `./` prefix | ✅ |\\n| MCP config | ✅ external .mcp.json file | ✅ |\\n| Dependencies | ✅ namespace@marketplace format | ✅ |\\n| Compatibility | ✅ claudeCode version constraint | ✅ |\\n| Marketplace sync | ✅ version 1.30.0 matches | ✅ |\\n\\n### ✅ Best Practices Compliance\\n\\n1. **Descriptive version notes in description** - ✅ \\\"v1.30.0: Added <critical_override> blocks...\\\"\\n2. **Clear capability summary** - ✅ \\\"45 skills\\\" helps users understand scope\\n3. **Technology stack keywords** - ✅ Comprehensive coverage\\n4. **Dependency declaration** - ✅ Explicit multimodel requirement\\n5. **Relative paths** - ✅ All component paths use `./` prefix for portability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison Summary\\n\\n| Metric | Dev | Frontend | Code-Analysis | Multimodel | Bun |\\n|--------|-----|----------|---------------|------------|-----|\\n| Agents | 15 | 11 | 1 | 0 | 3 |\\n| Commands | 14 | 8 | 3 | 1 | 4 |\\n| Skills | 40+ | 13 | 12 | 14 | 1 |\\n| Keywords | 41 | 10 | 13 | 18 | 13 |\\n| Dependencies | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| Has Hooks | No | No | Yes | Yes | No |\\n| Has Homepage | No | No | No | Yes | No |\\n\\n**Observation**: Dev plugin is the most comprehensive in terms of components (agents, commands, skills).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Potential Improvements (Optional)\\n\\nThese are **not issues** - the plugin.json is fully functional.

After comparing with 4 other plugins in the repository (frontend, code-analysis, multimodel, bun), the manifest demonstrates consistency with established patterns and includes all required fields.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Strengths\\n\\n1. **Complete Required Fields**\\n   - All mandatory fields present: `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`\\n   - Version matches marketplace.json entry (1.30.0) ✅\\n   - Proper semantic versioning\\n\\n2. **Consistent Author Information**\\n   - Matches pattern used across all plugins:\\n     ```json\\n     \\\"author\\\": {\\n       \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n       \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n       \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Comprehensive Component Declarations**\\n   - **15 agents** declared (vs 11 in frontend, 1 in code-analysis)\\n   - **14 commands** declared (vs 8 in frontend, 3 in code-analysis)\\n   - **40+ skills** declared (largest skill collection in the repository)\\n   - **1 output style** declared (self-improving.md)\\n   - All paths use correct relative format (`./agents/`, `./commands/`, `./skills/`)\\n\\n4. **MCP Server Configuration**\\n   - Uses `./.mcp.json` pattern (consistent with code-analysis plugin)\\n   - External file approach allows dynamic configuration\\n\\n5. **Dependency Management**\\n   - Declares dependency on `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0`\\n   - Uses proper namespace format `plugin@marketplace`\\n   - Semantic version constraint (^2.0.0) is appropriate\\n\\n6. **Compatibility Declaration**\\n   - `\\\"compatibility\\\": { \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\" }`\\n   - Matches pattern used in multimodel and code-analysis plugins\\n\\n7. **Keyword Richness**\\n   - 41 keywords covering broad tech stack\\n   - Includes language-specific keywords: react, typescript, golang, bun, python, rust\\n   - Includes domain keywords: orchestration, ui-design, LLMREI, multimodal\\n\\n8. **Category Classification**\\n   - `\\\"category\\\": \\\"development\\\"` - appropriate and consistent with frontend, code-analysis, bun\\n\\n### ⚠️ Minor Observations (Not Issues)\\n\\n1. **Field Naming Consistency**\\n   - Dev plugin uses `\\\"keywords\\\"` (array)\\n   - Multimodel plugin uses `\\\"tags\\\"` (array)\\n   - Both are valid, but inconsistent naming across repository\\n   - **Impact**: None - both work correctly\\n   - **Recommendation**: Consider standardizing on `keywords` (matches marketplace.json and most plugins)\\n\\n2. **Missing Optional Fields** (Compared to multimodel plugin)\\n   - No `\\\"homepage\\\"` field (multimodel has it)\\n   - No `\\\"skillBundles\\\"` (multimodel has organized skill groups)\\n   - **Impact**: None - these are optional features\\n   - **Note**: skillBundles could help organize 40+ skills\\n\\n3. **No Hooks Declaration**\\n   - Code-analysis and multimodel have `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n   - Dev plugin has no hooks\\n   - **Impact**: None - hooks are optional\\n\\n### ✅ Validation Against Repository Conventions\\n\\nChecked against patterns in 4 other plugins:\\n\\n| Convention | Dev Plugin | Status |\\n|------------|-----------|--------|\\n| Name format | ✅ lowercase, no special chars | ✅ |\\n| Version format | ✅ semantic versioning | ✅ |\\n| Author structure | ✅ name, email, company | ✅ |\\n| License field | ✅ \\\"MIT\\\" | ✅ |\\n| Category field | ✅ \\\"development\\\" | ✅ |\\n| Component paths | ✅ relative with `./` prefix | ✅ |\\n| MCP config | ✅ external .mcp.json file | ✅ |\\n| Dependencies | ✅ namespace@marketplace format | ✅ |\\n| Compatibility | ✅ claudeCode version constraint | ✅ |\\n| Marketplace sync | ✅ version 1.30.0 matches | ✅ |\\n\\n### ✅ Best Practices Compliance\\n\\n1. **Descriptive version notes in description** - ✅ \\\"v1.30.0: Added <critical_override> blocks...\\\"\\n2. **Clear capability summary** - ✅ \\\"45 skills\\\" helps users understand scope\\n3. **Technology stack keywords** - ✅ Comprehensive coverage\\n4. **Dependency declaration** - ✅ Explicit multimodel requirement\\n5. **Relative paths** - ✅ All component paths use `./` prefix for portability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison Summary\\n\\n| Metric | Dev | Frontend | Code-Analysis | Multimodel | Bun |\\n|--------|-----|----------|---------------|------------|-----|\\n| Agents | 15 | 11 | 1 | 0 | 3 |\\n| Commands | 14 | 8 | 3 | 1 | 4 |\\n| Skills | 40+ | 13 | 12 | 14 | 1 |\\n| Keywords | 41 | 10 | 13 | 18 | 13 |\\n| Dependencies | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| Has Hooks | No | No | Yes | Yes | No |\\n| Has Homepage | No | No | No | Yes | No |\\n\\n**Observation**: Dev plugin is the most comprehensive in terms of components (agents, commands, skills).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Potential Improvements (Optional)\\n\\nThese are **not issues** - the plugin.json is fully functional.

However, since `--models internal` was explicitly specified (single model), I'll present the result directly.\n\n**Step 4: Results**\n\n---\n\n## Team Verdict: APPROVED (Single Model)\n\n| Model | Vote | Confidence | Time |\n|-------|------|------------|------|\n| Internal (Claude Sonnet 4.5) | APPROVE | 10/10 | ~60s |\n\n**Result:** 1/1 APPROVE (100%)\n**Threshold:** Majority (50%)\n**Verdict:** APPROVED\n\n### Key Findings\n\nThe reviewer compared `plugins/dev/plugin.json` against 4 other plugins (frontend, code-analysis, multimodel, bun) and found:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. All required fields present (name, version, description, author, license)\n2. Version syncs with marketplace.json (1.30.0)\n3. Largest component collection in the repo: 15 agents, 14 commands, 40+ skills\n4. Proper dependency declaration (`multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0`)\n5. Compatibility constraint (`claudeCode: \">=0.1.0\"`)\n6. All paths use correct relative `./` prefix format\n\n**Minor Observations (non-blocking):**\n1. `keywords` vs `tags` inconsistency across repo (dev uses `keywords`, multimodel uses `tags`)\n2. No `skillBundles` grouping (could help organize 40+ skills)\n3. No `homepage` field (multimodel has one)\n\n### No Issues Found\n\nThe plugin.json is production-ready with no required changes.\n\n---\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n- **Plugin manifest conventions**: This repo uses a two-tier system -- each plugin has its own `plugin.json` AND the marketplace has a separate `marketplace.json` that aggregates all plugins. Version sync between these two files is critical (and validated by the reviewer).\n- **`dependencies` field**: The dev plugin is the only one that declares a dependency (`multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: ^2.0.0`). This uses npm-style semver ranges (`^` = compatible updates) with the `plugin@marketplace` namespace format, enabling the plugin loader to resolve cross-plugin dependencies.\n- **Single-model /team runs**: With `--models internal`, the review runs as a single Claude agent doing comparative analysis. The real power of `/team` emerges with 2+ models where independent blind votes reveal consensus and disagreements.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2745,"cache_read_input_tokens":56799,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2745,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"6ec6e0bb-d1fb-42c5-b81e-faec480361d0","uuid":"e7352d56-9cbb-4e81-93bc-f3a8c05b457b"}
