No issue.\n\n## Summary of Real Issues\n\n### High Priority\n1. **Plugin version mismatches** - Frontend (2.8.0 vs 2.7.0), Code Analysis (1.1.0 vs 2.15.0), Bun (1.2.0 vs 1.5.2)\n\n### Medium Priority\n2. **Duplicate documentation sections** - Lines 462 and 510 overlap\n3. **Roadmap version inconsistencies** - Doesn't reflect current plugin versions\n\n### Low Priority\n4. **Version format inconsistency** - Mix of \"v2.8.0\" and \"2.8.0\" formats\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Must Fix\n- Update all plugin versions to match actual releases\n- Remove or consolidate duplicate documentation sections\n- Update roadmap to reflect current state\n\n### Should Fix\n- Standardize version format (prefer \"vX.Y.Z\" throughout)\n\n### Nice to Have\n- Verify all linked documentation files exist\n\n## Formatting Quality Assessment\n\n**Overall Quality:** Good (7/10)\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clean, professional structure\n- Excellent use of visual hierarchy\n- Code examples clear and actionable\n- Navigation logical and intuitive\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Version information out of sync with actual releases\n- Some content duplication\n- Roadmap needs refresh\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: REJECT\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nSUMMARY: Multiple version mismatches and duplicate sections need fixing before README is production-ready.\nKEY_ISSUES: Plugin versions outdated (Code Analysis 1.1.0→2.15.0, Bun 1.2.0→1.5.2), Frontend version conflict (2.8.0 vs 2.7.0), duplicate documentation sections (lines 462 & 510), roadmap versions don't match current state\n```\n","numLines":128,"startLine":1,"totalLines":128}}}
