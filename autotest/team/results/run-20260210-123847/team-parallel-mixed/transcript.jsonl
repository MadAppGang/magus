Project-Specific Installation\n\nPlugins can be installed:\n- Globally (all projects)\n- Per-project (`.claude/settings.json`)\n- Teams use project-specific for consistency\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nclaude-code/\n├── README.md                  # Main documentation\n├── CLAUDE.md                  # This file\n├── .env.example              # Environment template\n├── LICENSE                   # MIT\n├── .gitignore               # Excludes secrets\n├── RELEASE_PROCESS.md        # Plugin release process guide\n├── docs/                    # User documentation\n│   ├── frontend-development.md\n│   └── local-development.md\n├── ai-docs/                 # Technical documentation\n│   ├── TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md\n│   ├── DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md\n│   ├── IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md\n│   ├── COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md\n│   └── FINAL_SUMMARY.md\n├── skills/                  # Project-level skills\n│   └── release/             # Plugin release process skill\n│       └── SKILL.md\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json\n└── plugins/\n    ├── multimodel/                   # Multi-model collaboration and orchestration\n    │   ├── plugin.json\n    │   ├── commands/                (team command)\n    │   └── skills/                  (14 skills)\n    ├── frontend/                     # Full-featured frontend plugin\n    │   ├── plugin.json\n    │   ├── DEPENDENCIES.md\n    │   ├── README.md\n    │   ├── agents/                   (11 agents)\n    │   ├── commands/                 (7 commands)\n    │   ├── skills/                   (11 skills)\n    │   └── mcp-servers/\n    ├── code-analysis/                # Code analysis plugin\n    │   ├── plugin.json\n    │   ├── agents/                   (1 agent)\n    │   ├── commands/                 (1 command)\n    │   └── skills/                   (2 skills)\n    └── bun/                          # Backend plugin\n        ├── plugin.json\n        ├── README.md\n        ├── agents/                   (3 agents)\n        ├── commands/                 (3 commands)\n        ├── skills/                   (1 skill)\n        └── mcp-servers/\n```\n\n## Important Files\n\n### For Users\n- `README.md` - Start here for installation and usage\n- `.env.example` - Template for required environment variables\n- `ai-docs/TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Setup guide\n- `skills/release/SKILL.md` - Plugin release process (for maintainers)\n\n### For Maintainers\n- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - Marketplace configuration ⚠️ **Update when releasing!**\n- `plugins/frontend/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest\n- `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Complete release process documentation\n- `skills/release/SKILL.md` - Quick reference release skill\n- `ai-docs/DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md` - MCP configuration patterns\n\n### For Contributors\n- `ai-docs/COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md` - Complete reference\n- `plugins/frontend/DEPENDENCIES.md` - Dependencies\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n### Required (Per Developer)\n```bash\nAPIDOG_API_TOKEN=your-personal-token\nFIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-personal-token\n```\n\n### Optional\n```bash\nGITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token\nCHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/path/to/chrome\nCODEX_API_KEY=your-codex-key\n```\n\n## Claude Code Plugin Requirements\n\n**Plugin System Format:**\n- Plugin manifest: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (must be in this location)\n- Settings format: `enabledPlugins` must be object with boolean values\n- Component directories: `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `mcp-servers/` at plugin root\n- Environment variables: Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths\n\n**Example Settings:**\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"plugin-name@marketplace-name\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n**System:**\n- Node.js v18+ (with npm/npx)\n- Chrome browser\n- Git\n\n**Optional:**\n- Codex CLI (for codex-powered code review)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n**Setup:** `/plugin marketplace add MadAppGang/claude-code`\n\n**Enable in `.claude/settings.json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"frontend@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"code-analysis@mag-claude-plugins\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Local dev:** `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-code`\n\n## Task Routing - Agent Delegation\n\nIMPORTANT: For complex tasks, prefer delegating to specialized agents via the Task tool rather than handling inline. Delegated agents run in dedicated context windows with sustained focus, producing higher quality results.\n\n| Task Pattern | Delegate To | Trigger |\n|---|---|---|\n| Research: web search, tech comparison, multi-source reports | `dev:researcher` | 3+ sources or comparison needed |\n| Implementation: creating code, new modules, features, building with tests | `dev:developer` | Writing new code, adding features, creating modules - even if they relate to existing codebase |\n| Investigation: READ-ONLY codebase analysis, tracing, understanding | `code-analysis:detective` | Only when task is to UNDERSTAND code, not to WRITE new code |\n| Debugging: error analysis, root cause investigation | `dev:debugger` | Non-obvious bugs or multi-file root cause |\n| Architecture: system design, trade-off analysis | `dev:architect` | New systems or major refactors |\n| Agent/plugin quality review | `agentdev:reviewer` | Agent description or plugin assessment |\n\nKey distinction: If the task asks to IMPLEMENT/CREATE/BUILD → `dev:developer`. If the task asks to UNDERSTAND/ANALYZE/TRACE → `code-analysis:detective`.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Shareable Config, Private Secrets** - Configuration in git, credentials in environment\n2. **Validation First** - Check before ask, validate before save\n3. **Team Ready** - Auto-install, consistent setup, no drift\n4. **Security First** - No secrets in git, personal tokens, clear docs\n5. **Developer Experience** - Smart defaults, clear errors, fast for returning users\n\n## Release Documentation\n\n**Version History:** See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for all versions\n\n**Detailed Release Notes:** See [RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md) for comprehensive release documentation\n\n**Current Versions:**\n- Multimodel Plugin: **v2.0.0** (2026-01-28)\n- Frontend Plugin: **v3.13.0** (2025-12-14)\n- Code Analysis Plugin: **v2.15.0** (2026-01-11)\n- Bun Backend Plugin: **v1.5.2** (2025-11-26)\n- Agent Development Plugin: **v1.4.0** (2026-01-05)\n- SEO Plugin: **v1.5.1** (2026-01-08)\n- Video Editing Plugin: **v1.0.1** (2026-01-06)\n- Nanobanana Plugin: **v2.2.3** (2026-01-08)\n- Conductor Plugin: **v2.0.1** (2026-01-06)\n- Dev Plugin: **v1.29.0** (2026-02-04)\n- Claudish CLI: See https://github.com/MadAppGang/claudish (separate repository)\n\n**Latest Changes (Code Analysis v2.15.0):**\n- ✅ **Hybrid 2+3 Hook Approach**: Results-first format with \"Task complete\" language\n- ✅ **71% Retry Reduction**: Agents treat denials as completions instead of retrying\n- ✅ **\"Completed via claudemem\"**: Success-like language in denial reasons\n- ✅ **Minimal Context**: 10 lines vs 32 lines (69% reduction in noise)\n- ✅ **Preserved Fallbacks**: Native tools still work when claudemem not indexed\n\n**Git Tags:**\n- Multimodel: `plugins/multimodel/v2.0.0`\n- Frontend: `plugins/frontend/v3.13.0`\n- Bun: `plugins/bun/v1.5.2`\n- Code Analysis: `plugins/code-analysis/v2.15.0`\n- Agent Development: `plugins/agentdev/v1.3.0`\n- SEO: `plugins/seo/v1.5.1`\n- Video Editing: `plugins/video-editing/v1.0.1`\n- Nanobanana: `plugins/nanobanana/v2.2.3`\n- Conductor: `plugins/conductor/v2.0.1`\n- Dev: `plugins/dev/v1.29.0`\n- Use correct tag format when releasing: `plugins/{plugin-name}/vX.Y.Z`\n\n**⚠️ RELEASE CHECKLIST (ALL 3 REQUIRED):**\nWhen releasing a plugin, you MUST update ALL THREE of these:\n1. **Plugin version** - `plugins/{name}/plugin.json` → `\"version\": \"X.Y.Z\"`\n2. **Marketplace version** - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin entry `\"version\": \"X.Y.Z\"`\n3. **Git tag** - `git tag -a plugins/{name}/vX.Y.Z -m \"Release message\"` → push with `--tags`\n\nMissing any of these will cause claudeup to not see the update!\n\n**⚠️ CLAUDEUP RELEASE PROCESS:**\nClaudeup (the TUI tool) has its own release process:\n1. **Update version** - `tools/claudeup/package.json` → `\"version\": \"X.Y.Z\"`\n2. **Commit changes** - `git commit -m \"feat(claudeup): vX.Y.Z - Description\"`\n3. **Create tag** - `git tag -a tools/claudeup/vX.Y.Z -m \"Release message\"`\n4. **Push** - `git push origin main --tags`\n\nThe workflow `.github/workflows/claudeup-release.yml` triggers on `tools/claudeup/v*` tags and:\n- Builds with pnpm\n- Publishes to npm via OIDC (no tokens needed - Trusted Publisher configured)\n- Creates GitHub release\n\n**Current claudeup version:** v1.3.0\n**Install:** `bun install -g claudeup@latest`\n\n---\n\n**Maintained by:** Jack Rudenko @ MadAppGang\n**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026\n**Version:** 10 plugins (Multimodel v2.0.0, Frontend v3.13.0, Code Analysis v2.15.0, Bun Backend v1.5.2, Agent Development v1.4.0, SEO v1.5.1, Video Editing v1.0.1, Nanobanana v2.2.3, Conductor v2.0.1, Dev v1.29.0)\n- do not use hardcoded path in code, docs, comments or any other files","numLines":275,"startLine":1,"totalLines":275}}}
