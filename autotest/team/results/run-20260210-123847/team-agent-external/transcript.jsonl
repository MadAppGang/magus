This is why automated validation (like this team review) is valuable.\n\n2. **Grok's thoroughness** - Notice how Grok went beyond just checking JSON structure - it cross-referenced the actual filesystem to find missing components. This is exactly the kind of analysis external models provide that differs from Claude's approach.\n\n3. **Single-model limitations** - With only one evaluator, we can't gauge consensus or identify potential blind spots. A 2-4 model team would provide multiple perspectives on severity and priority.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Actions\n\n1. **Add missing components to plugin.json:**\n   ```json\n   \"agents\": [\n     // ... existing agents ...\n     \"./agents/test-architect.md\"  // ADD THIS\n   ],\n   \"commands\": [\n     // ... existing commands ...\n     \"./commands/delegate.md\"  // ADD THIS\n   ],\n   \"skills\": [\n     // ... existing skills ...\n     \"./skills/task-routing\"  // ADD THIS\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Update description to match actual count** (verify final skill count after adding task-routing)\n\n3. **Consider updating multimodel dependency** to `^2.2.0` for accuracy\n\nWould you like me to make these fixes to the plugin.json file?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":300,"cache_read_input_tokens":50028,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":300,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ee3496e4-4ca6-4244-ab32-b56f1f5129ad","uuid":"ca386323-4634-4209-bd65-3b2682e41418"}
