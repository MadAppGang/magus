Missing Agent Declaration (CRITICAL)\n- **File exists:** `./agents/test-architect.md`\n- **Impact:** Agent exists but won't be loaded or available to users\n- **Fix:** Add to `agents` array in plugin.json\n\n### 2. Missing Command Declaration (CRITICAL)\n- **File exists:** `./commands/delegate.md`\n- **Impact:** Command exists but won't be registered (users can't invoke `/dev:delegate`)\n- **Fix:** Add to `commands` array in plugin.json\n\n### 3. Missing Skill Declarations (MODERATE)\n- **Files exist:**\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review/SKILL.md`\n  - `./skills/task-routing/SKILL.md`\n- **Impact:** Skills exist but won't be loaded or available for activation\n- **Fix:** Add both to `skills` array in plugin.json\n\n### 4. Inaccurate Description (MINOR)\n- **Claim:** \"45 skills\"\n- **Reality:** 44 declared in plugin.json, 46 actually on disk\n- **Impact:** Creates confusion about plugin capabilities\n- **Fix:** Update description to match actual count after fixing declarations\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Actions\n\n**Immediate (Required):**\n```json\n// Add to \"agents\" array:\n\"./agents/test-architect.md\"\n\n// Add to \"commands\" array:\n\"./commands/delegate.md\"\n\n// Add to \"skills\" array:\n\"./skills/design/ui-design-review\",\n\"./skills/task-routing\"\n```\n\n**Then update description:**\n```json\n\"description\": \"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 46 skills.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Strengths Identified\n\n✅ **Metadata completeness** - All required fields present (name, version, author, license)  \n✅ **Version consistency** - plugin.json (1.29.0) matches marketplace.json (1.29.0)  \n✅ **Path references** - All use correct relative format (`./agents/`, etc.)  \n✅ **File existence** - All declared components verified to exist on disk  \n✅ **Dependencies** - Properly declares multimodel@mag-claude-plugins ^2.0.0  \n✅ **Keywords** - Comprehensive and relevant 41-keyword list  \n✅ **MCP integration** - .mcp.json properly referenced  \n\n---\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Why This Matters:**\n1. **Functional Regression** - The test-architect agent and delegate command exist but are unreachable to users due to missing declarations\n2. **Silent Failures** - Claude Code plugin loader won't warn about undeclared files; they simply won't load\n3. **Maintenance Drift** - This discrepancy suggests files were added without updating the manifest, indicating a gap in the release checklist\n\n**Plugin Manifest Pattern:**\nThe plugin.json serves as the \"contract\" between the plugin and Claude Code. Only components explicitly declared in the arrays will be loaded, regardless of what files exist on disk.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":333,"cache_read_input_tokens":51660,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":333,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"36d59734-08fc-483d-b8f9-d3c7d5e6ebc7","uuid":"67dd725d-7f21-49fe-988a-2bd8796d0311"}
