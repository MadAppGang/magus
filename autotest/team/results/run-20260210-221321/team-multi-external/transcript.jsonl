The agents are working independently right now - they cannot see each other's responses, ensuring an unbiased evaluation.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"ae46a8a1-bc8b-48f4-b8c4-36a38b255812","total_cost_usd":0.84402825,"usage":{"input_tokens":97,"cache_creation_input_tokens":23277,"cache_read_input_tokens":321017,"output_tokens":3966,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":23277},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]},"modelUsage":{"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":119,"outputTokens":5297,"cacheReadInputTokens":412676,"cacheCreationInputTokens":79893,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.83868925,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":4194,"outputTokens":229,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.005339,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"f24945ab-a4fa-4feb-8738-b381c0da55b4"}
