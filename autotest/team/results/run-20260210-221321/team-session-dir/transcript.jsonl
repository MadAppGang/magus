Ship Like the Top 1%.\n\n**While you're fighting with AI prompts, elite teams are shipping 3x faster.**\n\nAt [MadAppGang](https://madappgang.com) and [10xLabs](https://10xlabs.com.au), we don't do \"good enough.\" We're the teams that Fortune 500 companies hire when their own developers can't deliver. We architect platforms processing **$50M+ in annual transactions**. We scale systems to **500,000+ concurrent users**. We ship features that make or break businesses.\n\n**Here's what separates us:** While most developers adopt new tools, we **engineer competitive advantages**.\n\nWhen Claude Code launched, we didn't experiment—we **weaponized it into production workflows** that have:\n\n⚡ **Generated $2.3M in value** through faster time-to-market on enterprise contracts\n⚡ **Eliminated 156+ hours per sprint** of repetitive development work\n⚡ **Shipped 47 major features** to production with zero rollbacks\n⚡ **Scaled to 23-person engineering teams** without losing velocity\n⚡ **Cut AI token costs by 40%** while improving output quality by 60%\n\n### The Brutal Truth About AI Development\n\n**Most developers are doing AI-assisted development wrong.**\n\nThey're copying prompts from Reddit. Following tutorials from people who've never shipped to production. Using workflows that optimize for demos, not delivery.\n\n**The cost?** Weeks of wasted time. Features that ship broken. AI bills that balloon. Teams that slow down instead of speed up.\n\n### What You Get: Production-Grade Workflows That Actually Ship\n\nEvery single workflow in these plugins was **forged in the fire of real deadlines**, real users, and real revenue. Not built for GitHub stars. Built to **win contracts and crush competitors**.\n\n#### The Stack That Ships\n\n**We don't use \"good enough\" tools. We use the tools that win.**\n\n- 🔥 **Tailwind CSS 4 & React 19** - Latest stable releases, not outdated patterns from 2023\n- 🔥 **Semantic code search** - 40% token reduction = **$1,200/month saved** on AI costs for mid-size teams\n- 🔥 **8-phase implementation workflows** - The exact process that shipped features to **half a million users**\n- 🔥 **MCP-powered integrations** - Figma → Code → Browser Testing → Production in one command\n- 🔥 **Zero-config team synchronization** - One file. Entire team aligned. No more \"works on my machine\"\n\n#### What This Actually Means for You\n\n**Stop burning cash on inefficient AI usage.** Our semantic search optimization alone has saved our teams **$14,000+ annually** in API costs.\n\n**Stop shipping buggy code.** Our multi-stage review system (manual + AI + browser testing) catches 89% of bugs before they hit production.\n\n**Stop reinventing workflows.** These plugins encode **2,500+ hours** of workflow optimization that you get in 60 seconds.\n\n### The Choice Is Simple\n\n**Option A:** Keep experimenting with generic AI prompts, watching your competitors ship faster, burning budget on trial-and-error.\n\n**Option B:** Use the exact workflows that elite teams use to **build products worth millions**.\n\nThese aren't \"best practices\" from blog posts. This is the **battle-tested playbook** that ships features to Fortune 500 clients, scales to hundreds of thousands of users, and wins against competitors with 10x your budget.\n\n**This is how the top 1% actually builds software in 2025.**\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 Update to Latest Version\n\n**Already installed?** Update to get the latest features:\n\n```bash\n/plugin marketplace update mag-claude-plugins\n```\n\n**This single command updates everything** - works for both global and local installations. No need to reinstall plugins.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Quick Start\n\n**Recommended Setup:** Add marketplace globally, enable plugins per-project.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Add marketplace globally (one-time setup)\n/plugin marketplace add MadAppGang/claude-code\n```\n\nThen add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"frontend@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"code-analysis@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"bun@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"orchestration@mag-claude-plugins\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**That's it!** The plugins are now enabled for this project. Commit `.claude/settings.json` so your team gets the same setup automatically.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What's Inside\n\nThis repository contains production-ready plugins designed for modern web development teams.

You only need to do this once, and it works for all your projects.\n\n#### Step 2: Enable Plugins in Your Project\n\nAdd or edit `.claude/settings.json` in your project root:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"frontend@mag-claude-plugins\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Commit this file to git:**\n\n```bash\ngit add .claude/settings.json\ngit commit -m \"Enable MAG Claude plugins for this project\"\ngit push\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Team Members Get Automatic Setup\n\nWhen team members who have added the marketplace (Step 1) pull your project, Claude Code automatically:\n\n1. Detects the enabled plugins\n2. Installs them for this project\n3. Activates them immediately\n\n**No manual installation needed!**\n\n#### Why This Approach?\n\n✅ **One-time marketplace setup** - Add the marketplace once, use in all projects\n✅ **Per-project plugin control** - Each project specifies its own plugins\n✅ **Team consistency** - Everyone gets the same plugins automatically\n✅ **Version controlled** - Plugin configuration committed with your code\n✅ **No environment drift** - All team members have identical plugin setup\n✅ **Project isolation** - Plugins only active where you need them\n\n#### Multiple Plugins\n\nNeed more than one plugin? Just add more entries:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enabledPlugins\": {\n    \"frontend@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"code-analysis@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"bun@mag-claude-plugins\": true,\n    \"orchestration@mag-claude-plugins\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nAfter setup, verify everything works:\n\n```bash\n# Check for any errors\n/doctor\n\n# List installed plugins\n/plugin list\n\n# Should show:\n# frontend@mag-claude-plugins (project-specific)\n#   Version: 1.2.0\n#   Status: ✓ Loaded\n```\n\n**Common issues:**\n- If `/doctor` shows errors, see [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) below\n- If plugin not listed, ensure marketplace was added in Step 1\n- Plugin activates automatically when you open a project with `.claude/settings.json`\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Usage Guide\n\n### Quick Start\n\nOnce installed, plugins work seamlessly with Claude Code:\n\n**Agents** are automatically invoked by Claude when appropriate, or you can request them explicitly.\n\n**Slash Commands** provide powerful one-line workflows for common tasks.\n\n**Skills** enhance Claude's capabilities and are automatically used when relevant.\n\n### Example: Full-Cycle Feature Implementation\n\n```bash\n/implement Create a user profile page with avatar upload and bio editing\n```\n\nThis single command:\n1. Plans the architecture and gets your approval\n2. Implements all components following your project patterns\n3. Reviews code with 3 different approaches (human + AI + browser)\n4. Generates comprehensive tests\n5. Cleans up artifacts\n6. Delivers production-ready code with documentation\n\n**Result:** Complete feature in minutes, not hours.\n\n### Example: Import Figma Design\n\n```bash\n/import-figma NavigationBar\n```\n\nFetches your Figma component, adapts it to your codebase, installs dependencies, and opens it in browser for validation.\n\n---\n\n**📖 For comprehensive documentation, examples, and detailed workflow explanations:**\n\n👉 **[Frontend Development Plugin - Complete Guide](./docs/frontend.md)**\n\nThe complete guide includes:\n- Detailed `/implement` workflow (all 7 stages explained)\n- Complete agent reference with use cases\n- All slash commands with examples\n- Skills documentation\n- MCP server setup guides\n- Troubleshooting and best practices\n\n---\n\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\n### For Users\n\n- **[Frontend Plugin Guide](./docs/frontend.md)** - Complete user guide with `/implement` workflow deep-dive\n- **[Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions\n- **[Advanced Usage](./docs/advanced-usage.md)** - Advanced configuration and workflows\n\n### For Developers\n\n- **[Development Guide](./docs/development-guide.md)** - How to create plugins\n- **[Contributing Guide](./docs/contributing.md)** - How to contribute to the marketplace\n- **[Marketplace Reference](./docs/marketplace-reference.md)** - Technical schemas and structure\n- **[Version Validation](./docs/VALIDATION.md)** - Automated version validation system (prevents marketplace/plugin version mismatches)\n\n### Technical Documentation\n\nFor architecture and implementation details, see the **[ai-docs](./ai-docs/)** directory:\n\n- **[TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md](./ai-docs/TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Team-first configuration\n- **[DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md](./ai-docs/DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md)** - MCP server configuration patterns\n- **[COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md](./ai-docs/COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md)** - Complete plugin inventory\n- **[SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SKILL_SUMMARY.md](./ai-docs/SEMANTIC_SEARCH_SKILL_SUMMARY.md)** - Semantic search skill design\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Roadmap\n\n### Current Focus\n\n- ✅ Frontend Development plugin (v2.7.0 - complete with CSS-aware validation & CVA best practices)\n- ✅ Code Analysis plugin (v1.1.0 - complete with semantic search)\n- ✅ Backend Development plugin (v1.2.0 - complete with Bun, camelCase conventions, Apidog integration)\n- 🚧 API Development plugin (planned)\n\n### Future Plugins\n\n- **Testing Tools**: E2E testing, visual regression, performance testing\n- **UI Components**: Design system tools, component generators\n- **Backend Development**: Node.js, API design, database tools\n- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD automation\n- **Documentation**: Auto-generate docs, API reference, guides\n\n### Community Requests\n\nHave a plugin idea?
