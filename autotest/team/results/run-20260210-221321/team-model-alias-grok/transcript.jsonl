Grok was able to definitively confirm version consistency through straightforward comparison, achieving 9/10 confidence without needing additional perspectives.\n\n**Version Management Architecture**: The dual-source version system (marketplace.json + individual plugin.json files) creates a natural gate for marketplace publication. Plugins must explicitly be added to marketplace.json to be published, preventing accidental releases of experimental features while maintaining centralized version tracking for production plugins.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":234,"cache_read_input_tokens":51823,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":234,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8d115706-a6c6-4e9b-b702-0dd980e63493","uuid":"27ad2405-c393-42cc-a7a1-e6d69b2808cb"}
