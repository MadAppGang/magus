After comparing with three other plugins (frontend, multimodel, code-analysis), the dev plugin demonstrates mature plugin architecture with comprehensive component registration, proper versioning, and clear metadata.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Core Metadata (Lines 2-10)\\n- **name**: \\\"dev\\\" ✓ (short, semantic)\\n- **version**: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✓ (semantic versioning)\\n- **description**: Detailed, version-stamped, includes feature count ✓\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, company ✓\\n- **license**: \\\"MIT\\\" ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: All required fields present. Description follows pattern seen in frontend plugin (includes version number and feature summary).\\n\\n### ✅ Keywords (Lines 11-42)\\n- **Count**: 31 keywords\\n- **Coverage**: Excellent breadth covering:\\n  - Dev patterns (orchestration, multi-stack, language-agnostic)\\n  - Technologies (react, golang, python, rust, typescript)\\n  - Methodologies (5-whys, LLMREI, react pattern)\\n  - Capabilities (self-improving, multimodal, vision)\\n\\n**Finding**: More comprehensive than frontend (20 keywords) and code-analysis (24 keywords). Good for discoverability.\\n\\n### ✅ Category (Line 43)\\n- **Value**: \\\"development\\\"\\n- **Consistency**: Matches frontend and code-analysis plugins ✓\\n\\n### ✅ MCP Servers (Line 44)\\n- **Path**: \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"\\n- **Pattern**: Matches code-analysis plugin ✓\\n- **Difference**: Frontend uses \\\"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json\\\" (nested structure)\\n\\n**Finding**: Valid pattern. Uses root-level .mcp.json instead of nested directory. Both patterns seen in repo.\\n\\n### ✅ Agents (Lines 45-61)\\n- **Count**: 15 agents registered\\n- **Paths**: All use \\\"./agents/{name}.md\\\" format ✓\\n- **Notable agents**:\\n  - stack-detector (auto-detection capability)\\n  - skill-discovery (dynamic skill loading)\\n  - developer, debugger, architect (core dev agents)\\n  - researcher, synthesizer (research workflow)\\n  - doc-writer, doc-analyzer, doc-fixer (documentation trilogy)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Verified against directory listing - all 15 files exist ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Comprehensive agent set.

Consider skill bundles for better UX with 44+ skills\\n2. Evaluate hooks system for enforcement patterns\\n3. Add homepage field (like multimodel plugin)\\n4. Consider tags field (multimodel uses this instead of keywords)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Adherence to Claude Code Conventions\\n\\n### ✅ Followed Conventions\\n- Plugin manifest location: Root of plugin directory ✓\\n- Component paths: Relative paths with ./ prefix ✓\\n- Version format: Semantic versioning ✓\\n- Author structure: Object with name/email/company ✓\\n- Agent/command file format: Markdown files ✓\\n- Skill directory format: Directory-based skills ✓\\n- Dependencies format: plugin@marketplace notation ✓\\n\\n### 📋 Optional Fields Used\\n- keywords (instead of tags)\\n- outputStyles (unique to dev plugin)\\n- dependencies (good practice)\\n\\n### ❌ Missing Optional Fields\\n- hooks (used by 2 other plugins)\\n- skillBundles (used by multimodel)\\n- homepage (used by multimodel)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound and follows all required conventions**, but has **three blocking issues** that prevent full functionality:\\n\\n1. Unregistered `delegate` command (exists in filesystem)\\n2. Unregistered `task-routing` skill (exists in filesystem)\\n3. Inaccurate documentation (skill count mismatch)\\n\\nThese issues suggest recent additions (delegate command and task-routing skill) were not properly registered during the last update. The description version stamp is v1.29.0 (February 4, 2026 per git log), and per CLAUDE.md context, delegate was added recently for task routing improvements.\\n\\n**The plugin structure is excellent overall**, with comprehensive coverage, good organization, and proper metadata. The issues are administrative (missing registrations) rather than architectural.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is well-formed but missing registrations for delegate command and task-routing skill that exist in filesystem, causing functional gaps.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Unregistered delegate.md command, unregistered task-routing skill, inaccurate skill count (44 vs 45 claimed)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Appendix: Verification Commands\\n\\n```bash\\n# Verify command count\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/ | wc -l\\n# Expected: 13, plugin.json has: 12\\n\\n# Verify skill count\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills/ | wc -l\\n# Expected: 18 directories, plugin.json has: 44 entries (some are nested)\\n\\n# Check delegate command\\ncat /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md\\n# Exists: YES\\n\\n# Check task-routing skill\\nls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills/task-routing/\\n# Exists: YES\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":1248,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":23240,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":1248,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyYwp6dUKy3wYcTz9K9N\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.168Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"uuid\":\"c6d0aa7c-8863-4401-9f5c-a87a4f713ae5\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c6d0aa7c-8863-4401-9f5c-a87a4f713ae5\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"uuid\":\"e2cdcf07-f5dc-4d57-a78a-05a6a52af496\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-125129-28bebe66/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"6c0d0feb-a8dc-4753-83fa-b5a7a4b57329\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\"}\n</output>"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51","uuid":"09e4370a-0b6e-4e81-af1e-3c5601813f72","tool_use_result":{"retrieval_status":"success","task":{"task_id":"ac90353","task_type":"local_agent","status":"completed","description":"Grok vote on dev plugin.json","output":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\\n\\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

After comparing with three other plugins (frontend, multimodel, code-analysis), the dev plugin demonstrates mature plugin architecture with comprehensive component registration, proper versioning, and clear metadata.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Core Metadata (Lines 2-10)\\n- **name**: \\\"dev\\\" ✓ (short, semantic)\\n- **version**: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✓ (semantic versioning)\\n- **description**: Detailed, version-stamped, includes feature count ✓\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, company ✓\\n- **license**: \\\"MIT\\\" ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: All required fields present. Description follows pattern seen in frontend plugin (includes version number and feature summary).\\n\\n### ✅ Keywords (Lines 11-42)\\n- **Count**: 31 keywords\\n- **Coverage**: Excellent breadth covering:\\n  - Dev patterns (orchestration, multi-stack, language-agnostic)\\n  - Technologies (react, golang, python, rust, typescript)\\n  - Methodologies (5-whys, LLMREI, react pattern)\\n  - Capabilities (self-improving, multimodal, vision)\\n\\n**Finding**: More comprehensive than frontend (20 keywords) and code-analysis (24 keywords). Good for discoverability.\\n\\n### ✅ Category (Line 43)\\n- **Value**: \\\"development\\\"\\n- **Consistency**: Matches frontend and code-analysis plugins ✓\\n\\n### ✅ MCP Servers (Line 44)\\n- **Path**: \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"\\n- **Pattern**: Matches code-analysis plugin ✓\\n- **Difference**: Frontend uses \\\"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json\\\" (nested structure)\\n\\n**Finding**: Valid pattern. Uses root-level .mcp.json instead of nested directory. Both patterns seen in repo.\\n\\n### ✅ Agents (Lines 45-61)\\n- **Count**: 15 agents registered\\n- **Paths**: All use \\\"./agents/{name}.md\\\" format ✓\\n- **Notable agents**:\\n  - stack-detector (auto-detection capability)\\n  - skill-discovery (dynamic skill loading)\\n  - developer, debugger, architect (core dev agents)\\n  - researcher, synthesizer (research workflow)\\n  - doc-writer, doc-analyzer, doc-fixer (documentation trilogy)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Verified against directory listing - all 15 files exist ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Comprehensive agent set. More agents than frontend (11) but organized similarly.\\n\\n### ✅ Commands (Lines 62-75)\\n- **Count**: 12 commands registered\\n- **Paths**: All use \\\"./commands/{name}.md\\\" format ✓\\n- **Notable commands**:\\n  - help (user guidance)\\n  - implement, debug, feature (core dev workflows)\\n  - architect, brainstorm (planning)\\n  - ui, create-style (design integration)\\n  - interview (requirements elicitation)\\n  - deep-research (research workflow)\\n  - doc (documentation)\\n  - learn (self-improvement)\\n  - delegate (NEW - task routing)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Directory listing shows 13 commands but plugin.json lists 12.\\n\\n**ISSUE FOUND**: `delegate.md` exists in directory but NOT registered in plugin.json!\\n\\n**Finding**: Missing registration of delegate command. This is a blocking issue.\\n\\n### ✅ Output Styles (Lines 76-78)\\n- **Count**: 1 output style\\n- **Path**: \\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\" ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Unique feature not seen in other plugins. Good for customization.\\n\\n### ⚠️ Skills (Lines 79-124)\\n- **Count**: 44 skills registered (description claims 45)\\n- **Organization**: Excellent hierarchical structure:\\n  - context-detection (root level)\\n  - core/* (4 skills: universal, testing, debugging)\\n  - frontend/* (10 skills: react, vue, tanstack, shadcn)\\n  - backend/* (13 skills: api, database, golang, bunjs, python, rust)\\n  - design/* (4 skills: ui analysis/implementation)\\n  - documentation-standards (root level)\\n  - discipline/* (4 skills: verification, TDD, debugging, coordination)\\n  - plugin-sdk-patterns (root level)\\n  - audit, optimize, test-coverage (root level)\\n  - mcp-standards, adr-documentation (root level)\\n  - planning/* (1 skill: brainstorming)\\n  - enforcement (root level)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Directory listing shows 18 directories in skills/. Detailed count needed.\\n\\n**Counting registered skills**:\\n- context-detection: 1\\n- core: 3 entries\\n- frontend: 10 entries\\n- backend: 13 entries\\n- design: 4 entries\\n- documentation-standards: 1\\n- discipline: 4 entries\\n- plugin-sdk-patterns: 1\\n- audit: 1\\n- optimize: 1\\n- test-coverage: 1\\n- mcp-standards: 1\\n- adr-documentation: 1\\n- planning: 1\\n- enforcement: 1\\n\\n**Total**: 44 skills registered\\n\\n**ISSUE FOUND**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but only 44 registered. Off by 1.\\n\\n**Cross-check with directory**: task-routing skill directory exists but NOT registered!\\n\\n**CRITICAL ISSUE**: `task-routing` skill exists in filesystem but missing from plugin.json. This is referenced by the delegate command (per CLAUDE.md context), making this a functional issue.\\n\\n### ✅ Dependencies (Lines 125-127)\\n- **Declared**: multimodel@mag-claude-plugins ^2.0.0 ✓\\n- **Pattern**: Follows plugin dependency format ✓\\n- **Validation**: Multimodel plugin exists in repo at v2.2.0, satisfies ^2.0.0 ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Proper dependency declaration. Good for orchestration capabilities.\\n\\n### ✅ Compatibility (Lines 128-130)\\n- **claudeCode**: \\\">=0.1.0\\\" ✓\\n- **Pattern**: Same as all other plugins ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Standard compatibility declaration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n| Feature | dev | frontend | multimodel | code-analysis |\\n|---------|-----|----------|------------|---------------|\\n| Agents | 15 | 11 | 0 | 1 |\\n| Commands | 12 (13 in dir) | 8 | 1 | 3 |\\n| Skills | 44 (45 claimed) | 13 | 14 | 12 |\\n| Output Styles | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| MCP Servers | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |\\n| Hooks | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |\\n| Dependencies | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| Skill Bundles | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |\\n\\n**Notable differences**:\\n1. **dev plugin is most comprehensive** in terms of agents, commands, and skills\\n2. **dev plugin lacks hooks** (used by multimodel and code-analysis for enforcement)\\n3. **dev plugin declares dependency** on multimodel (orchestration capability)\\n4. **multimodel uses skillBundles** for logical grouping (dev could benefit from this)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)\\n\\n1. **Missing `delegate` command registration** (Line 62-75)\\n   - **Evidence**: `commands/delegate.md` exists in directory but not in plugin.json\\n   - **Impact**: Command won't be recognized by Claude Code CLI\\n   - **Fix**: Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n   - **Context**: Per CLAUDE.md, this command was recently added for task routing\\n\\n2. **Missing `task-routing` skill registration** (Line 79-124)\\n   - **Evidence**: `skills/task-routing/` directory exists but not in plugin.json\\n   - **Impact**: Skill won't be loadable by delegate command (references it via frontmatter)\\n   - **Fix**: Add `\\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"` to skills array\\n   - **Context**: Required for `/dev:delegate` command functionality\\n\\n3. **Inaccurate skill count in description** (Line 4)\\n   - **Evidence**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but only 44 registered (43 after fixing task-routing)\\n   - **Impact**: User confusion, incorrect documentation\\n   - **Fix**: Update description to \\\"44 skills\\\" (or \\\"45 skills\\\" after adding task-routing)\\n\\n### 🟡 Minor Issues (Nice to Have)\\n\\n4. **No skill bundles** (Missing field)\\n   - **Evidence**: Multimodel plugin uses skillBundles for logical grouping\\n   - **Impact**: Users must load all 44 skills or know exact names\\n   - **Fix**: Consider adding skillBundles like:\\n     ```json\\n     \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n       \\\"core\\\": [\\\"context-detection\\\", \\\"core/universal-patterns\\\", \\\"core/testing-strategies\\\", \\\"core/debugging-strategies\\\"],\\n       \\\"frontend\\\": [\\\"frontend/*\\\"],\\n       \\\"backend\\\": [\\\"backend/*\\\"],\\n       \\\"discipline\\\": [\\\"discipline/*\\\"]\\n     }\\n     ```\\n   - **Priority**: Low (nice-to-have for large plugin)\\n\\n5. **No hooks system** (Missing field)\\n   - **Evidence**: Code-analysis and multimodel both use hooks\\n   - **Impact**: No validation/enforcement at tool-call level\\n   - **Fix**: Consider adding hooks for enforcement (like multimodel's PROXY_MODE check)\\n   - **Priority**: Low (depends on enforcement needs)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions (Before Next Release)\\n1. ✅ Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n2. ✅ Add `\\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"` to skills array\\n3. ✅ Update version to 1.29.1 (patch fix)\\n4. ✅ Update description skill count to match actual count\\n5. ✅ Test delegate command works after registration\\n\\n### Future Enhancements (Next Minor Version)\\n1. Consider skill bundles for better UX with 44+ skills\\n2. Evaluate hooks system for enforcement patterns\\n3. Add homepage field (like multimodel plugin)\\n4. Consider tags field (multimodel uses this instead of keywords)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Adherence to Claude Code Conventions\\n\\n### ✅ Followed Conventions\\n- Plugin manifest location: Root of plugin directory ✓\\n- Component paths: Relative paths with ./ prefix ✓\\n- Version format: Semantic versioning ✓\\n- Author structure: Object with name/email/company ✓\\n- Agent/command file format: Markdown files ✓\\n- Skill directory format: Directory-based skills ✓\\n- Dependencies format: plugin@marketplace notation ✓\\n\\n### 📋 Optional Fields Used\\n- keywords (instead of tags)\\n- outputStyles (unique to dev plugin)\\n- dependencies (good practice)\\n\\n### ❌ Missing Optional Fields\\n- hooks (used by 2 other plugins)\\n- skillBundles (used by multimodel)\\n- homepage (used by multimodel)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound and follows all required conventions**, but has **three blocking issues** that prevent full functionality:\\n\\n1. Unregistered `delegate` command (exists in filesystem)\\n2. Unregistered `task-routing` skill (exists in filesystem)\\n3. Inaccurate documentation (skill count mismatch)\\n\\nThese issues suggest recent additions (delegate command and task-routing skill) were not properly registered during the last update. The description version stamp is v1.29.0 (February 4, 2026 per git log), and per CLAUDE.md context, delegate was added recently for task routing improvements.\\n\\n**The plugin structure is excellent overall**, with comprehensive coverage, good organization, and proper metadata. The issues are administrative (missing registrations) rather than architectural.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is well-formed but missing registrations for delegate command and task-routing skill that exist in filesystem, causing functional gaps.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Unregistered delegate.md command, unregistered task-routing skill, inaccurate skill count (44 vs 45 claimed)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Appendix: Verification Commands\\n\\n```bash\\n# Verify command count\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/ | wc -l\\n# Expected: 13, plugin.json has: 12\\n\\n# Verify skill count\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills/ | wc -l\\n# Expected: 18 directories, plugin.json has: 44 entries (some are nested)\\n\\n# Check delegate command\\ncat /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md\\n# Exists: YES\\n\\n# Check task-routing skill\\nls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills/task-routing/\\n# Exists: YES\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":1248,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":23240,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":1248,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyYwp6dUKy3wYcTz9K9N\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.168Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"uuid\":\"c6d0aa7c-8863-4401-9f5c-a87a4f713ae5\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c6d0aa7c-8863-4401-9f5c-a87a4f713ae5\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"uuid\":\"e2cdcf07-f5dc-4d57-a78a-05a6a52af496\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-125129-28bebe66/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"6c0d0feb-a8dc-4753-83fa-b5a7a4b57329\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

After comparing with three other plugins (frontend, multimodel, code-analysis), the dev plugin demonstrates mature plugin architecture with comprehensive component registration, proper versioning, and clear metadata.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Core Metadata (Lines 2-10)\\n- **name**: \\\"dev\\\" ✓ (short, semantic)\\n- **version**: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✓ (semantic versioning)\\n- **description**: Detailed, version-stamped, includes feature count ✓\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, company ✓\\n- **license**: \\\"MIT\\\" ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: All required fields present. Description follows pattern seen in frontend plugin (includes version number and feature summary).\\n\\n### ✅ Keywords (Lines 11-42)\\n- **Count**: 31 keywords\\n- **Coverage**: Excellent breadth covering:\\n  - Dev patterns (orchestration, multi-stack, language-agnostic)\\n  - Technologies (react, golang, python, rust, typescript)\\n  - Methodologies (5-whys, LLMREI, react pattern)\\n  - Capabilities (self-improving, multimodal, vision)\\n\\n**Finding**: More comprehensive than frontend (20 keywords) and code-analysis (24 keywords). Good for discoverability.\\n\\n### ✅ Category (Line 43)\\n- **Value**: \\\"development\\\"\\n- **Consistency**: Matches frontend and code-analysis plugins ✓\\n\\n### ✅ MCP Servers (Line 44)\\n- **Path**: \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"\\n- **Pattern**: Matches code-analysis plugin ✓\\n- **Difference**: Frontend uses \\\"./mcp-servers/mcp-config.json\\\" (nested structure)\\n\\n**Finding**: Valid pattern. Uses root-level .mcp.json instead of nested directory. Both patterns seen in repo.\\n\\n### ✅ Agents (Lines 45-61)\\n- **Count**: 15 agents registered\\n- **Paths**: All use \\\"./agents/{name}.md\\\" format ✓\\n- **Notable agents**:\\n  - stack-detector (auto-detection capability)\\n  - skill-discovery (dynamic skill loading)\\n  - developer, debugger, architect (core dev agents)\\n  - researcher, synthesizer (research workflow)\\n  - doc-writer, doc-analyzer, doc-fixer (documentation trilogy)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Verified against directory listing - all 15 files exist ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Comprehensive agent set. More agents than frontend (11) but organized similarly.\\n\\n### ✅ Commands (Lines 62-75)\\n- **Count**: 12 commands registered\\n- **Paths**: All use \\\"./commands/{name}.md\\\" format ✓\\n- **Notable commands**:\\n  - help (user guidance)\\n  - implement, debug, feature (core dev workflows)\\n  - architect, brainstorm (planning)\\n  - ui, create-style (design integration)\\n  - interview (requirements elicitation)\\n  - deep-research (research workflow)\\n  - doc (documentation)\\n  - learn (self-improvement)\\n  - delegate (NEW - task routing)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Directory listing shows 13 commands but plugin.json lists 12.\\n\\n**ISSUE FOUND**: `delegate.md` exists in directory but NOT registered in plugin.json!\\n\\n**Finding**: Missing registration of delegate command. This is a blocking issue.\\n\\n### ✅ Output Styles (Lines 76-78)\\n- **Count**: 1 output style\\n- **Path**: \\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\" ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Unique feature not seen in other plugins. Good for customization.\\n\\n### ⚠️ Skills (Lines 79-124)\\n- **Count**: 44 skills registered (description claims 45)\\n- **Organization**: Excellent hierarchical structure:\\n  - context-detection (root level)\\n  - core/* (4 skills: universal, testing, debugging)\\n  - frontend/* (10 skills: react, vue, tanstack, shadcn)\\n  - backend/* (13 skills: api, database, golang, bunjs, python, rust)\\n  - design/* (4 skills: ui analysis/implementation)\\n  - documentation-standards (root level)\\n  - discipline/* (4 skills: verification, TDD, debugging, coordination)\\n  - plugin-sdk-patterns (root level)\\n  - audit, optimize, test-coverage (root level)\\n  - mcp-standards, adr-documentation (root level)\\n  - planning/* (1 skill: brainstorming)\\n  - enforcement (root level)\\n\\n**Cross-check**: Directory listing shows 18 directories in skills/. Detailed count needed.\\n\\n**Counting registered skills**:\\n- context-detection: 1\\n- core: 3 entries\\n- frontend: 10 entries\\n- backend: 13 entries\\n- design: 4 entries\\n- documentation-standards: 1\\n- discipline: 4 entries\\n- plugin-sdk-patterns: 1\\n- audit: 1\\n- optimize: 1\\n- test-coverage: 1\\n- mcp-standards: 1\\n- adr-documentation: 1\\n- planning: 1\\n- enforcement: 1\\n\\n**Total**: 44 skills registered\\n\\n**ISSUE FOUND**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but only 44 registered. Off by 1.\\n\\n**Cross-check with directory**: task-routing skill directory exists but NOT registered!\\n\\n**CRITICAL ISSUE**: `task-routing` skill exists in filesystem but missing from plugin.json. This is referenced by the delegate command (per CLAUDE.md context), making this a functional issue.\\n\\n### ✅ Dependencies (Lines 125-127)\\n- **Declared**: multimodel@mag-claude-plugins ^2.0.0 ✓\\n- **Pattern**: Follows plugin dependency format ✓\\n- **Validation**: Multimodel plugin exists in repo at v2.2.0, satisfies ^2.0.0 ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Proper dependency declaration. Good for orchestration capabilities.\\n\\n### ✅ Compatibility (Lines 128-130)\\n- **claudeCode**: \\\">=0.1.0\\\" ✓\\n- **Pattern**: Same as all other plugins ✓\\n\\n**Finding**: Standard compatibility declaration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n| Feature | dev | frontend | multimodel | code-analysis |\\n|---------|-----|----------|------------|---------------|\\n| Agents | 15 | 11 | 0 | 1 |\\n| Commands | 12 (13 in dir) | 8 | 1 | 3 |\\n| Skills | 44 (45 claimed) | 13 | 14 | 12 |\\n| Output Styles | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| MCP Servers | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |\\n| Hooks | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |\\n| Dependencies | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\\n| Skill Bundles | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ |\\n\\n**Notable differences**:\\n1. **dev plugin is most comprehensive** in terms of agents, commands, and skills\\n2. **dev plugin lacks hooks** (used by multimodel and code-analysis for enforcement)\\n3. **dev plugin declares dependency** on multimodel (orchestration capability)\\n4. **multimodel uses skillBundles** for logical grouping (dev could benefit from this)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)\\n\\n1. **Missing `delegate` command registration** (Line 62-75)\\n   - **Evidence**: `commands/delegate.md` exists in directory but not in plugin.json\\n   - **Impact**: Command won't be recognized by Claude Code CLI\\n   - **Fix**: Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n   - **Context**: Per CLAUDE.md, this command was recently added for task routing\\n\\n2. **Missing `task-routing` skill registration** (Line 79-124)\\n   - **Evidence**: `skills/task-routing/` directory exists but not in plugin.json\\n   - **Impact**: Skill won't be loadable by delegate command (references it via frontmatter)\\n   - **Fix**: Add `\\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"` to skills array\\n   - **Context**: Required for `/dev:delegate` command functionality\\n\\n3. **Inaccurate skill count in description** (Line 4)\\n   - **Evidence**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but only 44 registered (43 after fixing task-routing)\\n   - **Impact**: User confusion, incorrect documentation\\n   - **Fix**: Update description to \\\"44 skills\\\" (or \\\"45 skills\\\" after adding task-routing)\\n\\n### 🟡 Minor Issues (Nice to Have)\\n\\n4. **No skill bundles** (Missing field)\\n   - **Evidence**: Multimodel plugin uses skillBundles for logical grouping\\n   - **Impact**: Users must load all 44 skills or know exact names\\n   - **Fix**: Consider adding skillBundles like:\\n     ```json\\n     \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n       \\\"core\\\": [\\\"context-detection\\\", \\\"core/universal-patterns\\\", \\\"core/testing-strategies\\\", \\\"core/debugging-strategies\\\"],\\n       \\\"frontend\\\": [\\\"frontend/*\\\"],\\n       \\\"backend\\\": [\\\"backend/*\\\"],\\n       \\\"discipline\\\": [\\\"discipline/*\\\"]\\n     }\\n     ```\\n   - **Priority**: Low (nice-to-have for large plugin)\\n\\n5. **No hooks system** (Missing field)\\n   - **Evidence**: Code-analysis and multimodel both use hooks\\n   - **Impact**: No validation/enforcement at tool-call level\\n   - **Fix**: Consider adding hooks for enforcement (like multimodel's PROXY_MODE check)\\n   - **Priority**: Low (depends on enforcement needs)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions (Before Next Release)\\n1. ✅ Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n2. ✅ Add `\\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"` to skills array\\n3. ✅ Update version to 1.29.1 (patch fix)\\n4. ✅ Update description skill count to match actual count\\n5. ✅ Test delegate command works after registration\\n\\n### Future Enhancements (Next Minor Version)\\n1. Consider skill bundles for better UX with 44+ skills\\n2. Evaluate hooks system for enforcement patterns\\n3. Add homepage field (like multimodel plugin)\\n4. Consider tags field (multimodel uses this instead of keywords)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Adherence to Claude Code Conventions\\n\\n### ✅ Followed Conventions\\n- Plugin manifest location: Root of plugin directory ✓\\n- Component paths: Relative paths with ./ prefix ✓\\n- Version format: Semantic versioning ✓\\n- Author structure: Object with name/email/company ✓\\n- Agent/command file format: Markdown files ✓\\n- Skill directory format: Directory-based skills ✓\\n- Dependencies format: plugin@marketplace notation ✓\\n\\n### 📋 Optional Fields Used\\n- keywords (instead of tags)\\n- outputStyles (unique to dev plugin)\\n- dependencies (good practice)\\n\\n### ❌ Missing Optional Fields\\n- hooks (used by 2 other plugins)\\n- skillBundles (used by multimodel)\\n- homepage (used by multimodel)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound and follows all required conventions**, but has **three blocking issues** that prevent full functionality:\\n\\n1. Unregistered `delegate` command (exists in filesystem)\\n2. Unregistered `task-routing` skill (exists in filesystem)\\n3. Inaccurate documentation (skill count mismatch)\\n\\nThese issues suggest recent additions (delegate command and task-routing skill) were not properly registered during the last update. The description version stamp is v1.29.0 (February 4, 2026 per git log), and per CLAUDE.md context, delegate was added recently for task routing improvements.\\n\\n**The plugin structure is excellent overall**, with comprehensive coverage, good organization, and proper metadata. The issues are administrative (missing registrations) rather than architectural.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is well-formed but missing registrations for delegate command and task-routing skill that exist in filesystem, causing functional gaps.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Unregistered delegate.md command, unregistered task-routing skill, inaccurate skill count (44 vs 45 claimed)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Appendix: Verification Commands\\n\\n```bash\\n# Verify command count\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/ | wc -l\\n# Expected: 13, plugin.json has: 12\\n\\n# Verify skill count\\nls -1 /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills/ | wc -l\\n# Expected: 18 directories, plugin.json has: 44 entries (some are nested)\\n\\n# Check delegate command\\ncat /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/delegate.md\\n# Exists: YES\\n\\n# Check task-routing skill\\nls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/skills/task-routing/\\n# Exists: YES\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":1248,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":23240,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":1248,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyYwp6dUKy3wYcTz9K9N\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.168Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"uuid\":\"c6d0aa7c-8863-4401-9f5c-a87a4f713ae5\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c6d0aa7c-8863-4401-9f5c-a87a4f713ae5\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"uuid\":\"e2cdcf07-f5dc-4d57-a78a-05a6a52af496\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"a00e3a56-3041-48a0-9faa-d58857993d51\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ac90353\",\"slug\":\"recursive-jumping-zebra\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_012pLHs8Xr7QVeVczz5pTnV8\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-125129-28bebe66/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"6c0d0feb-a8dc-4753-83fa-b5a7a4b57329\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:53:04.173Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"0d0389c0-76d8-4a98-a6ea-0bdedb4e18ae\"}\n"}}}
