fields populated with quality information\\n4. **Valid JSON**: Properly formatted, parseable JSON\\n5. **Correct Path Format**: All relative paths use proper `./` prefix\\n6. **Dependencies Declared**: Properly declares multimodel plugin dependency\\n7. **MCP Integration**: External MCP server (claudish) correctly configured\\n8. **Nested Skills**: Properly handles multi-level skill directories (e.g., `backend/bunjs`)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\nBased on repository context, the dev plugin follows the same conventions as:\\n- `frontend` plugin (11 agents, 7 commands)\\n- `multimodel` plugin (team orchestration)\\n- `code-analysis` plugin (enrichment mode)\\n\\nThe dev plugin is the **largest** plugin in the repository with the most components.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1: Add Missing Components\\n\\nUpdate `plugin.json` to include:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"commands\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"skills\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./skills/design/ui-design-review\\\",\\n  \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 2: Update Skill Count\\n\\nAfter adding missing skills (46 total), update description:\\n```\\n\\\"45 skills.\\\" → \\\"46 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 3: Consider Directory Audit Process\\n\\nCreate a validation script to detect undeclared components:\\n```bash\\n# Example: Check for agents not in plugin.json\\ncomm -13 \\\\\\n  <(grep -o '[^/]*\\\\.md' plugin.json | sort -u) \\\\\\n  <(ls agents/*.md | xargs -n1 basename | sort -u)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Details\\n\\n**Method**: Automated file system verification\\n- Read plugin.json manifest\\n- Listed all directories (agents/, commands/, skills/, output-styles/)\\n- Cross-referenced every declared path with actual file existence\\n- Identified undeclared components via directory diff\\n- Verified SKILL.md presence for all skill directories\\n\\n**Files Checked**: 77 total (16 agents, 13 commands, 46 skills, 1 output-style, 1 MCP config)\\n\\n**Pass Rate**: 97.4% (75/77 correctly declared or properly excluded)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: APPROVE\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is well-organized and follows conventions correctly, with only 3 missing component references (non-blocking).\\nKEY_ISSUES: test-architect.md agent not declared, delegate.md command not declared, 2 skills (ui-design-review, task-routing) not declared, description claims 45 skills but has 44 declared\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":360,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":25680,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":360,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyYndgonVjxon8Y5vciL\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"d0063d16-98a7-41bc-86ff-f2ef8f998b44\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:50:34.514Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"d0063d16-98a7-41bc-86ff-f2ef8f998b44\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"27f7fa83-b12b-43e6-bd7c-f1377db259ab\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a513857\",\"slug\":\"idempotent-greeting-gem\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun

However, there are **3 missing component references** that should be added for completeness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structure Analysis\\n\\n### ✅ Correct Convention Compliance\\n\\n1. **Metadata Fields** - All required fields present and valid:\\n   - `name`: \\\"dev\\\" ✓\\n   - `version`: \\\"1.29.0\\\" ✓\\n   - `description`: Comprehensive with version and skill count ✓\\n   - `author`: Complete with name, email, company ✓\\n   - `license`: \\\"MIT\\\" ✓\\n   - `category`: \\\"development\\\" ✓\\n   - `keywords`: 41 keywords (comprehensive coverage) ✓\\n\\n2. **Component Arrays** - Proper relative paths:\\n   - `agents`: 15 files listed, all use `./agents/*.md` format ✓\\n   - `commands`: 12 files listed, all use `./commands/*.md` format ✓\\n   - `skills`: 44 paths listed, all use `./skills/...` format ✓\\n   - `outputStyles`: 1 file listed, uses `./output-styles/*.md` format ✓\\n\\n3. **Dependencies & Compatibility**:\\n   - `dependencies`: Declares `multimodel@mag-claude-plugins: \\\"^2.0.0\\\"` ✓\\n   - `compatibility`: Specifies `claudeCode: \\\">=0.1.0\\\"` ✓\\n\\n4. **MCP Servers**:\\n   - `mcpServers`: References `./.mcp.json` ✓\\n   - File exists and contains valid JSON with claudish MCP server ✓\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Component Verification\\n\\n### Agents (15 listed, 16 exist)\\n\\n**All 15 declared agents exist on disk:**\\n- ✓ stack-detector.md\\n- ✓ skill-discovery.md\\n- ✓ developer.md\\n- ✓ debugger.md\\n- ✓ architect.md\\n- ✓ ui.md\\n- ✓ ui-engineer.md\\n- ✓ scribe.md\\n- ✓ spec-writer.md\\n- ✓ devops.md\\n- ✓ researcher.md\\n- ✓ synthesizer.md\\n- ✓ doc-writer.md\\n- ✓ doc-analyzer.md\\n- ✓ doc-fixer.md\\n\\n**❌ Missing from plugin.json:**\\n- `test-architect.md` - Exists on disk, not declared\\n\\n### Commands (12 listed, 13 exist)\\n\\n**All 12 declared commands exist on disk:**\\n- ✓ help.md\\n- ✓ implement.md\\n- ✓ debug.md\\n- ✓ feature.md\\n- ✓ architect.md\\n- ✓ brainstorm.md\\n- ✓ ui.md\\n- ✓ create-style.md\\n- ✓ interview.md\\n- ✓ deep-research.md\\n- ✓ doc.md\\n- ✓ learn.md\\n\\n**❌ Missing from plugin.json:**\\n- `delegate.md` - Exists on disk, not declared\\n\\n### Skills (44 listed, 46 exist)\\n\\n**All 44 declared skills exist on disk with valid SKILL.md files** ✓\\n\\n**❌ Missing from plugin.json:**\\n- `design/ui-design-review` - Has SKILL.md, not declared\\n- `task-routing` - Has SKILL.md, not declared\\n\\n### Output Styles (1 listed, 1 exists)\\n\\n**All declared output styles exist on disk:**\\n- ✓ self-improving.md\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🔴 Critical Issues\\n\\n**None.** The plugin is functional and follows all conventions correctly.\\n\\n### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues\\n\\n**1. Missing Component References (3 components)**\\n\\nThe following files exist on disk but are not declared in `plugin.json`:\\n\\n- **Agent**: `./agents/test-architect.md`\\n  - Purpose: Black box test architect for TDD workflows\\n  - Should be added to `agents` array\\n\\n- **Command**: `./commands/delegate.md`\\n  - Purpose: Task routing command using `dev:task-routing` skill\\n  - Should be added to `commands` array\\n\\n- **Skills** (2):\\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review`\\n  - `./skills/task-routing`\\n  - Both have valid SKILL.md files\\n  - Should be added to `skills` array\\n\\n**Impact**: These components exist but won't be loaded by Claude Code. Users can't invoke them.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Add all 3 missing references to plugin.json\\n\\n### 🟢 Minor Issues\\n\\n**1. Description Claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but declares 44**\\n\\nCurrent description:\\n```\\n\\\"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 45 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nActual count:\\n- Declared in plugin.json: 44 skills\\n- Exist on disk: 46 skills (44 declared + 2 undeclared)\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Update description to match actual count after adding missing skills.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 15 agents, 12 commands, 44 skills provide extensive functionality\\n2. **Organized Structure**: Skills are well-categorized (core, frontend, backend, design, discipline)\\n3. **Complete Metadata**: All optional fields populated with quality information\\n4. **Valid JSON**: Properly formatted, parseable JSON\\n5. **Correct Path Format**: All relative paths use proper `./` prefix\\n6. **Dependencies Declared**: Properly declares multimodel plugin dependency\\n7. **MCP Integration**: External MCP server (claudish) correctly configured\\n8. **Nested Skills**: Properly handles multi-level skill directories (e.g., `backend/bunjs`)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\nBased on repository context, the dev plugin follows the same conventions as:\\n- `frontend` plugin (11 agents, 7 commands)\\n- `multimodel` plugin (team orchestration)\\n- `code-analysis` plugin (enrichment mode)\\n\\nThe dev plugin is the **largest** plugin in the repository with the most components.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1: Add Missing Components\\n\\nUpdate `plugin.json` to include:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"commands\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"skills\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./skills/design/ui-design-review\\\",\\n  \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 2: Update Skill Count\\n\\nAfter adding missing skills (46 total), update description:\\n```\\n\\\"45 skills.\\\" → \\\"46 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 3: Consider Directory Audit Process\\n\\nCreate a validation script to detect undeclared components:\\n```bash\\n# Example: Check for agents not in plugin.json\\ncomm -13 \\\\\\n  <(grep -o '[^/]*\\\\.md' plugin.json | sort -u) \\\\\\n  <(ls agents/*.md | xargs -n1 basename | sort -u)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Details\\n\\n**Method**: Automated file system verification\\n- Read plugin.json manifest\\n- Listed all directories (agents/, commands/, skills/, output-styles/)\\n- Cross-referenced every declared path with actual file existence\\n- Identified undeclared components via directory diff\\n- Verified SKILL.md presence for all skill directories\\n\\n**Files Checked**: 77 total (16 agents, 13 commands, 46 skills, 1 output-style, 1 MCP config)\\n\\n**Pass Rate**: 97.4% (75/77 correctly declared or properly excluded)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: APPROVE\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is well-organized and follows conventions correctly, with only 3 missing component references (non-blocking).\\nKEY_ISSUES: test-architect.md agent not declared, delegate.md command not declared, 2 skills (ui-design-review, task-routing) not declared, description claims 45 skills but has 44 declared\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":360,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":25680,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":360,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyYndgonVjxon8Y5vciL\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"d0063d16-98a7-41bc-86ff-f2ef8f998b44\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:50:34.514Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"d0063d16-98a7-41bc-86ff-f2ef8f998b44\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"27f7fa83-b12b-43e6-bd7c-f1377db259ab\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a513857\",\"slug\":\"idempotent-greeting-gem\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun

Missing Component References (3 components)**\\n\\nThe following files exist on disk but are not declared in `plugin.json`:\\n\\n- **Agent**: `./agents/test-architect.md`\\n  - Purpose: Black box test architect for TDD workflows\\n  - Should be added to `agents` array\\n\\n- **Command**: `./commands/delegate.md`\\n  - Purpose: Task routing command using `dev:task-routing` skill\\n  - Should be added to `commands` array\\n\\n- **Skills** (2):\\n  - `./skills/design/ui-design-review`\\n  - `./skills/task-routing`\\n  - Both have valid SKILL.md files\\n  - Should be added to `skills` array\\n\\n**Impact**: These components exist but won't be loaded by Claude Code. Users can't invoke them.\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Add all 3 missing references to plugin.json\\n\\n### 🟢 Minor Issues\\n\\n**1. Description Claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but declares 44**\\n\\nCurrent description:\\n```\\n\\\"Universal development assistant with real skill discovery. v1.29.0: Added phase completion enforcement system with evidence-based validation, failure reporting, and manual testing steps. 45 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nActual count:\\n- Declared in plugin.json: 44 skills\\n- Exist on disk: 46 skills (44 declared + 2 undeclared)\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Update description to match actual count after adding missing skills.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 15 agents, 12 commands, 44 skills provide extensive functionality\\n2. **Organized Structure**: Skills are well-categorized (core, frontend, backend, design, discipline)\\n3. **Complete Metadata**: All optional fields populated with quality information\\n4. **Valid JSON**: Properly formatted, parseable JSON\\n5. **Correct Path Format**: All relative paths use proper `./` prefix\\n6. **Dependencies Declared**: Properly declares multimodel plugin dependency\\n7. **MCP Integration**: External MCP server (claudish) correctly configured\\n8. **Nested Skills**: Properly handles multi-level skill directories (e.g., `backend/bunjs`)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\nBased on repository context, the dev plugin follows the same conventions as:\\n- `frontend` plugin (11 agents, 7 commands)\\n- `multimodel` plugin (team orchestration)\\n- `code-analysis` plugin (enrichment mode)\\n\\nThe dev plugin is the **largest** plugin in the repository with the most components.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1: Add Missing Components\\n\\nUpdate `plugin.json` to include:\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"agents\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"commands\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n],\\n\\\"skills\\\": [\\n  ...existing,\\n  \\\"./skills/design/ui-design-review\\\",\\n  \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 2: Update Skill Count\\n\\nAfter adding missing skills (46 total), update description:\\n```\\n\\\"45 skills.\\\" → \\\"46 skills.\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Priority 3: Consider Directory Audit Process\\n\\nCreate a validation script to detect undeclared components:\\n```bash\\n# Example: Check for agents not in plugin.json\\ncomm -13 \\\\\\n  <(grep -o '[^/]*\\\\.md' plugin.json | sort -u) \\\\\\n  <(ls agents/*.md | xargs -n1 basename | sort -u)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Details\\n\\n**Method**: Automated file system verification\\n- Read plugin.json manifest\\n- Listed all directories (agents/, commands/, skills/, output-styles/)\\n- Cross-referenced every declared path with actual file existence\\n- Identified undeclared components via directory diff\\n- Verified SKILL.md presence for all skill directories\\n\\n**Files Checked**: 77 total (16 agents, 13 commands, 46 skills, 1 output-style, 1 MCP config)\\n\\n**Pass Rate**: 97.4% (75/77 correctly declared or properly excluded)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: APPROVE\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is well-organized and follows conventions correctly, with only 3 missing component references (non-blocking).\\nKEY_ISSUES: test-architect.md agent not declared, delegate.md command not declared, 2 skills (ui-design-review, task-routing) not declared, description claims 45 skills but has 44 declared\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":360,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":25680,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":360,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyYndgonVjxon8Y5vciL\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"d0063d16-98a7-41bc-86ff-f2ef8f998b44\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T01:50:34.514Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"d0063d16-98a7-41bc-86ff-f2ef8f998b44\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"27f7fa83-b12b-43e6-bd7c-f1377db259ab\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a513857\",\"slug\":\"idempotent-greeting-gem\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun
