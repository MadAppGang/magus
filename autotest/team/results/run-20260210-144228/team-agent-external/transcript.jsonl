Initial count was off.\\n\\n### 12 Commands Declared → 13 Commands Present ⚠️\\n**Declared:**\\n1. help.md ✓\\n2. implement.md ✓\\n3. debug.md ✓\\n4. feature.md ✓\\n5. architect.md ✓\\n6. brainstorm.md ✓\\n7. ui.md ✓\\n8. create-style.md ✓\\n9. interview.md ✓\\n10. deep-research.md ✓\\n11. doc.md ✓\\n12. learn.md ✓\\n\\n**Actual files in commands/:**\\nAll 12 declared + **delegate.md** (not declared)\\n\\n**Issue**: `delegate.md` exists but is not in plugin.json\\n\\n### 44 Skills Declared → 46 Skills Present ⚠️\\n**Declared count**: 44 skill directories (lines 79-123)\\n**Actual SKILL.md files**: 46 found via find command\\n\\n**Discrepancy**: Plugin.json claims \\\"45 skills\\\" in description (line 4) but only declares 44 paths in the skills array.\\n\\n**Missing from manifest**:\\n- `task-routing` skill exists but not declared (added 2026-02-10 per MEMORY.md)\\n- One other skill unaccounted for\\n\\n### 1 Output Style Declared → 1 Present ✅\\n- `self-improving.md` declared and exists\\n\\n### Hooks Configuration Missing ❌\\n**Directory exists**: `hooks/` with `feature-enforcement.json`\\n**Manifest declaration**: **NONE**\\n\\n**Expected**:\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Actual**: No hooks field in plugin.json\\n\\n**Comparison with other plugins**:\\n- multimodel plugin: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"` ✓\\n- code-analysis plugin: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"` ✓\\n- dev plugin: **Missing** ❌\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Issues\\n\\n### 1. Hooks Declaration Missing (CRITICAL)\\nThe plugin has enforcement infrastructure but doesn't declare it:\\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` exists with PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks\\n- Scripts referenced: `phase-completion-validator.js`, `outer-loop-enforcer.js`, etc.\\n- **No `hooks` field in plugin.json**\\n\\n**Impact**: Claude Code won't load the hooks, enforcement system is non-functional\\n\\n### 2. Command Declaration Incomplete (MEDIUM)\\n`delegate.md` command exists but not declared in plugin.json\\n- Command added recently (2026-02-10 per MEMORY.md)\\n- Likely forgot to update manifest\\n\\n**Impact**: Command may not be discoverable via `/dev:delegate`\\n\\n### 3. Skill Count Mismatch (LOW)\\n- Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Skills array declares 44 paths\\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\\n\\n**Issues**:\\n- `task-routing` skill exists but not in manifest (recent addition)\\n- Description string out of sync with reality\\n\\n**Impact**: Minor documentation inconsistency, may confuse users\\n\\n### 4. Skills Use Directory Paths, Not File Paths (NEUTRAL)\\nUnlike agents/commands which use `./path/file.md`, skills use `./skills/directory` format\\n- Agents: `\\\"./agents/developer.md\\\"` ✓\\n- Commands: `\\\"./commands/implement.md\\\"` ✓\\n- Skills: `\\\"./skills/core/universal-patterns\\\"` (no .md, no SKILL.md)\\n\\n**Analysis**: Checking other plugins:\\n- multimodel: `\\\"multi-agent-coordination\\\"` (no path, just name)\\n- code-analysis: `\\\"./skills/deep-analysis\\\"` (directory path)\\n- frontend: `\\\"./skills/core-principles\\\"` (directory path)\\n\\n**Conclusion**: This is **standard practice** for skills in this codebase. Skills point to directories containing SKILL.md, not the markdown files directly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best Practices Assessment\\n\\n### ✅ Follows Best Practices\\n1. **Semantic versioning**: 1.29.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)\\n2. **Descriptive keywords**: 41 comprehensive tags\\n3. **Full author metadata**: Name, email, company\\n4. **Explicit dependencies**: Declares multimodel dependency with version constraint\\n5. **Compatibility declaration**: Claude Code version specified\\n6. **Relative paths**: Uses `./` prefix for all component paths\\n7. **Output styles**: Declares custom output formatting\\n8. **MCP integration**: Points to .mcp.json for server configuration\\n\\n### ⚠️ Deviations from Best Practices\\n1. **No hooks declaration**: Despite having hooks infrastructure\\n2. **Incomplete command declarations**: Missing recently added command\\n3. **Version string in description**: Redundant with version field (but useful for users)\\n4. **Skill count in description**: Manual counter prone to drift (currently off by 1-2)\\n\\n### 📊 Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n| Feature | dev | multimodel | code-analysis | frontend |\\n|---------|-----|------------|---------------|----------|\\n| Hooks declared | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| All components listed | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\\n| Version in description | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\\n| Component count in desc | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n| Output styles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n\\n**Pattern**: Frontend also lacks hooks declaration, suggesting this may be a recent feature not yet universally adopted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Findings\\n\\n### Finding 1: Hooks Infrastructure Not Activated\\n**Evidence**:\\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` contains full hook configuration\\n- File defines PreToolUse hooks for TaskUpdate tool\\n- File defines PostToolUse hooks for Write tool\\n- References enforcement scripts in `scripts/` directory\\n- **plugin.json has no `\\\"hooks\\\"` field**\\n\\n**Root Cause**: Manifest not updated after adding enforcement system\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Standard pattern uses `hooks.json`, but dev plugin uses `feature-enforcement.json`. Code-analysis plugin structure:\\n```\\nhooks/\\n  hooks.json (main config)\\n  enrichment-preread.sh\\n  enrichment-postread.sh\\n```\\n\\nDev plugin could:\\n1. Rename to `hooks/hooks.json` (standard)\\n2. Keep as is, reference correctly (also valid)\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Reference existing file: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"`\\n\\n### Finding 2: Missing Command Declaration\\n**Evidence**:\\n- File exists: `commands/delegate.md`\\n- Added 2026-02-10 (per MEMORY.md)\\n- Purpose: On-demand delegation routing with task-routing skill\\n- **Not in plugin.json commands array**\\n\\n**Impact**: Command may not be indexed by Claude Code's plugin system\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n```json\\n\\\"commands\\\": [\\n  \\\"./commands/help.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/implement.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/debug.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/feature.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/architect.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/brainstorm.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/ui.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/create-style.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/interview.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/deep-research.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/doc.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/learn.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"  // ADD THIS\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Finding 3: Skill Count Discrepancy\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Description: \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Plugin.json skills array: 44 entries\\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\\n\\n**Known missing**:\\n- `task-routing` skill (added 2026-02-10, pairs with delegate command)\\n\\n**Other potential missing**: One unidentified skill (46 - 44 - 1 = 1)\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n1. Add task-routing to skills array:\\n```json\\n\\\"skills\\\": [\\n  // ... existing entries ...\\n  \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n2. Verify the 46th skill by checking all directories:\\n```bash\\nfind plugins/dev/skills -name \\\"SKILL.md\\\" -exec dirname {} \\\\;\\n```\\n\\n3. Update description to match reality (likely \\\"46 skills\\\" or \\\"45 skills\\\" after verification)\\n\\n### Finding 4: Output Styles - Rare Feature Usage\\n**Observation**: Only dev plugin declares output styles in this codebase\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- dev: `\\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\"]`\\n- multimodel: No outputStyles field\\n- code-analysis: No outputStyles field\\n- frontend: No outputStyles field\\n\\n**Assessment**: This is **GOOD**, not an issue. Output styles are a valid but rarely-used plugin feature. Dev plugin using this shows advanced feature adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Blocking)\\n1. **Add hooks declaration**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Without this, enforcement system is dead code.\\n\\n2. **Add delegate.md to commands array**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Otherwise command may not load correctly.\\n\\n### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Quality)\\n3. **Add task-routing to skills array**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Audit all skill directories and update count**:\\n   - Verify 46 SKILL.md files against 44 declared paths\\n   - Update description string to match (\\\"46 skills\\\" or confirm 45)\\n\\n### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Polish)\\n5. **Consider standardizing hooks filename**:\\n   - Current: `feature-enforcement.json`\\n   - Standard: `hooks.json`\\n   - Both work, but consistency helps maintainability\\n\\n6. **Add categories/tags for skill bundles**:\\n   - multimodel plugin uses `skillBundles` field\\n   - Helps organize 45+ skills for discoverability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound but operationally incomplete**. The schema is correct, version tracking is excellent, and most components are properly declared. However, the missing hooks declaration is a **critical issue** that prevents the enforcement system from functioning.\\n\\nThe plugin demonstrates advanced feature usage (output styles, comprehensive keywords, dependencies) but fell behind in maintenance during recent additions (delegate command, task-routing skill).\\n\\n**Overall Assessment**: 85/100\\n- Schema: 95/100 (excellent structure)\\n- Completeness: 70/100 (missing 3+ components)\\n- Consistency: 100/100 (version alignment perfect)\\n- Best practices: 80/100 (follows most patterns)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Missing critical hooks declaration prevents enforcement system from loading; also missing recent command/skill declarations\\nKEY_ISSUES: No hooks field for feature-enforcement.json, delegate.md command not declared, task-routing skill not declared, skill count mismatch (44 declared vs 46 actual)\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":911,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":28651,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":911,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyheX4mrGeQgNkvQ857D\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.913Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"uuid\":\"e7165761-9c86-4051-8746-42453d6ec096\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"e7165761-9c86-4051-8746-42453d6ec096\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"uuid\":\"e447950f-81e8-4c4d-8ebb-ac3adff7e69a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-144526-a499ee57/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"f02e5910-1a6a-4d59-af2a-02f466919534\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\"}\n</output>"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0","uuid":"cdd2fab7-9fdb-4195-9aa7-53df263ee57a","tool_use_result":{"retrieval_status":"success","task":{"task_id":"a7ab257","task_type":"local_agent","status":"completed","description":"Grok vote on dev plugin.json","output":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\\n\\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

Initial count was off.\\n\\n### 12 Commands Declared → 13 Commands Present ⚠️\\n**Declared:**\\n1. help.md ✓\\n2. implement.md ✓\\n3. debug.md ✓\\n4. feature.md ✓\\n5. architect.md ✓\\n6. brainstorm.md ✓\\n7. ui.md ✓\\n8. create-style.md ✓\\n9. interview.md ✓\\n10. deep-research.md ✓\\n11. doc.md ✓\\n12. learn.md ✓\\n\\n**Actual files in commands/:**\\nAll 12 declared + **delegate.md** (not declared)\\n\\n**Issue**: `delegate.md` exists but is not in plugin.json\\n\\n### 44 Skills Declared → 46 Skills Present ⚠️\\n**Declared count**: 44 skill directories (lines 79-123)\\n**Actual SKILL.md files**: 46 found via find command\\n\\n**Discrepancy**: Plugin.json claims \\\"45 skills\\\" in description (line 4) but only declares 44 paths in the skills array.\\n\\n**Missing from manifest**:\\n- `task-routing` skill exists but not declared (added 2026-02-10 per MEMORY.md)\\n- One other skill unaccounted for\\n\\n### 1 Output Style Declared → 1 Present ✅\\n- `self-improving.md` declared and exists\\n\\n### Hooks Configuration Missing ❌\\n**Directory exists**: `hooks/` with `feature-enforcement.json`\\n**Manifest declaration**: **NONE**\\n\\n**Expected**:\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Actual**: No hooks field in plugin.json\\n\\n**Comparison with other plugins**:\\n- multimodel plugin: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"` ✓\\n- code-analysis plugin: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"` ✓\\n- dev plugin: **Missing** ❌\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Structural Issues\\n\\n### 1. Hooks Declaration Missing (CRITICAL)\\nThe plugin has enforcement infrastructure but doesn't declare it:\\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` exists with PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks\\n- Scripts referenced: `phase-completion-validator.js`, `outer-loop-enforcer.js`, etc.\\n- **No `hooks` field in plugin.json**\\n\\n**Impact**: Claude Code won't load the hooks, enforcement system is non-functional\\n\\n### 2. Command Declaration Incomplete (MEDIUM)\\n`delegate.md` command exists but not declared in plugin.json\\n- Command added recently (2026-02-10 per MEMORY.md)\\n- Likely forgot to update manifest\\n\\n**Impact**: Command may not be discoverable via `/dev:delegate`\\n\\n### 3. Skill Count Mismatch (LOW)\\n- Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Skills array declares 44 paths\\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\\n\\n**Issues**:\\n- `task-routing` skill exists but not in manifest (recent addition)\\n- Description string out of sync with reality\\n\\n**Impact**: Minor documentation inconsistency, may confuse users\\n\\n### 4. Skills Use Directory Paths, Not File Paths (NEUTRAL)\\nUnlike agents/commands which use `./path/file.md`, skills use `./skills/directory` format\\n- Agents: `\\\"./agents/developer.md\\\"` ✓\\n- Commands: `\\\"./commands/implement.md\\\"` ✓\\n- Skills: `\\\"./skills/core/universal-patterns\\\"` (no .md, no SKILL.md)\\n\\n**Analysis**: Checking other plugins:\\n- multimodel: `\\\"multi-agent-coordination\\\"` (no path, just name)\\n- code-analysis: `\\\"./skills/deep-analysis\\\"` (directory path)\\n- frontend: `\\\"./skills/core-principles\\\"` (directory path)\\n\\n**Conclusion**: This is **standard practice** for skills in this codebase. Skills point to directories containing SKILL.md, not the markdown files directly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best Practices Assessment\\n\\n### ✅ Follows Best Practices\\n1. **Semantic versioning**: 1.29.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)\\n2. **Descriptive keywords**: 41 comprehensive tags\\n3. **Full author metadata**: Name, email, company\\n4. **Explicit dependencies**: Declares multimodel dependency with version constraint\\n5. **Compatibility declaration**: Claude Code version specified\\n6. **Relative paths**: Uses `./` prefix for all component paths\\n7. **Output styles**: Declares custom output formatting\\n8. **MCP integration**: Points to .mcp.json for server configuration\\n\\n### ⚠️ Deviations from Best Practices\\n1. **No hooks declaration**: Despite having hooks infrastructure\\n2. **Incomplete command declarations**: Missing recently added command\\n3. **Version string in description**: Redundant with version field (but useful for users)\\n4. **Skill count in description**: Manual counter prone to drift (currently off by 1-2)\\n\\n### 📊 Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n| Feature | dev | multimodel | code-analysis | frontend |\\n|---------|-----|------------|---------------|----------|\\n| Hooks declared | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| All components listed | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\\n| Version in description | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\\n| Component count in desc | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n| Output styles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n\\n**Pattern**: Frontend also lacks hooks declaration, suggesting this may be a recent feature not yet universally adopted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Findings\\n\\n### Finding 1: Hooks Infrastructure Not Activated\\n**Evidence**:\\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` contains full hook configuration\\n- File defines PreToolUse hooks for TaskUpdate tool\\n- File defines PostToolUse hooks for Write tool\\n- References enforcement scripts in `scripts/` directory\\n- **plugin.json has no `\\\"hooks\\\"` field**\\n\\n**Root Cause**: Manifest not updated after adding enforcement system\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Standard pattern uses `hooks.json`, but dev plugin uses `feature-enforcement.json`. Code-analysis plugin structure:\\n```\\nhooks/\\n  hooks.json (main config)\\n  enrichment-preread.sh\\n  enrichment-postread.sh\\n```\\n\\nDev plugin could:\\n1. Rename to `hooks/hooks.json` (standard)\\n2. Keep as is, reference correctly (also valid)\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Reference existing file: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"`\\n\\n### Finding 2: Missing Command Declaration\\n**Evidence**:\\n- File exists: `commands/delegate.md`\\n- Added 2026-02-10 (per MEMORY.md)\\n- Purpose: On-demand delegation routing with task-routing skill\\n- **Not in plugin.json commands array**\\n\\n**Impact**: Command may not be indexed by Claude Code's plugin system\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n```json\\n\\\"commands\\\": [\\n  \\\"./commands/help.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/implement.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/debug.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/feature.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/architect.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/brainstorm.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/ui.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/create-style.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/interview.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/deep-research.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/doc.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/learn.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"  // ADD THIS\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Finding 3: Skill Count Discrepancy\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Description: \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Plugin.json skills array: 44 entries\\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\\n\\n**Known missing**:\\n- `task-routing` skill (added 2026-02-10, pairs with delegate command)\\n\\n**Other potential missing**: One unidentified skill (46 - 44 - 1 = 1)\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n1. Add task-routing to skills array:\\n```json\\n\\\"skills\\\": [\\n  // ... existing entries ...\\n  \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n2. Verify the 46th skill by checking all directories:\\n```bash\\nfind plugins/dev/skills -name \\\"SKILL.md\\\" -exec dirname {} \\\\;\\n```\\n\\n3. Update description to match reality (likely \\\"46 skills\\\" or \\\"45 skills\\\" after verification)\\n\\n### Finding 4: Output Styles - Rare Feature Usage\\n**Observation**: Only dev plugin declares output styles in this codebase\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- dev: `\\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\"]`\\n- multimodel: No outputStyles field\\n- code-analysis: No outputStyles field\\n- frontend: No outputStyles field\\n\\n**Assessment**: This is **GOOD**, not an issue. Output styles are a valid but rarely-used plugin feature. Dev plugin using this shows advanced feature adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Blocking)\\n1. **Add hooks declaration**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Without this, enforcement system is dead code.\\n\\n2. **Add delegate.md to commands array**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Otherwise command may not load correctly.\\n\\n### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Quality)\\n3. **Add task-routing to skills array**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Audit all skill directories and update count**:\\n   - Verify 46 SKILL.md files against 44 declared paths\\n   - Update description string to match (\\\"46 skills\\\" or confirm 45)\\n\\n### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Polish)\\n5. **Consider standardizing hooks filename**:\\n   - Current: `feature-enforcement.json`\\n   - Standard: `hooks.json`\\n   - Both work, but consistency helps maintainability\\n\\n6. **Add categories/tags for skill bundles**:\\n   - multimodel plugin uses `skillBundles` field\\n   - Helps organize 45+ skills for discoverability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound but operationally incomplete**. The schema is correct, version tracking is excellent, and most components are properly declared. However, the missing hooks declaration is a **critical issue** that prevents the enforcement system from functioning.\\n\\nThe plugin demonstrates advanced feature usage (output styles, comprehensive keywords, dependencies) but fell behind in maintenance during recent additions (delegate command, task-routing skill).\\n\\n**Overall Assessment**: 85/100\\n- Schema: 95/100 (excellent structure)\\n- Completeness: 70/100 (missing 3+ components)\\n- Consistency: 100/100 (version alignment perfect)\\n- Best practices: 80/100 (follows most patterns)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Missing critical hooks declaration prevents enforcement system from loading; also missing recent command/skill declarations\\nKEY_ISSUES: No hooks field for feature-enforcement.json, delegate.md command not declared, task-routing skill not declared, skill count mismatch (44 declared vs 46 actual)\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":911,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":28651,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":911,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyheX4mrGeQgNkvQ857D\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.913Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"uuid\":\"e7165761-9c86-4051-8746-42453d6ec096\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"e7165761-9c86-4051-8746-42453d6ec096\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"uuid\":\"e447950f-81e8-4c4d-8ebb-ac3adff7e69a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-144526-a499ee57/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"f02e5910-1a6a-4d59-af2a-02f466919534\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

Hooks Declaration Missing (CRITICAL)\\nThe plugin has enforcement infrastructure but doesn't declare it:\\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` exists with PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks\\n- Scripts referenced: `phase-completion-validator.js`, `outer-loop-enforcer.js`, etc.\\n- **No `hooks` field in plugin.json**\\n\\n**Impact**: Claude Code won't load the hooks, enforcement system is non-functional\\n\\n### 2. Command Declaration Incomplete (MEDIUM)\\n`delegate.md` command exists but not declared in plugin.json\\n- Command added recently (2026-02-10 per MEMORY.md)\\n- Likely forgot to update manifest\\n\\n**Impact**: Command may not be discoverable via `/dev:delegate`\\n\\n### 3. Skill Count Mismatch (LOW)\\n- Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Skills array declares 44 paths\\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\\n\\n**Issues**:\\n- `task-routing` skill exists but not in manifest (recent addition)\\n- Description string out of sync with reality\\n\\n**Impact**: Minor documentation inconsistency, may confuse users\\n\\n### 4. Skills Use Directory Paths, Not File Paths (NEUTRAL)\\nUnlike agents/commands which use `./path/file.md`, skills use `./skills/directory` format\\n- Agents: `\\\"./agents/developer.md\\\"` ✓\\n- Commands: `\\\"./commands/implement.md\\\"` ✓\\n- Skills: `\\\"./skills/core/universal-patterns\\\"` (no .md, no SKILL.md)\\n\\n**Analysis**: Checking other plugins:\\n- multimodel: `\\\"multi-agent-coordination\\\"` (no path, just name)\\n- code-analysis: `\\\"./skills/deep-analysis\\\"` (directory path)\\n- frontend: `\\\"./skills/core-principles\\\"` (directory path)\\n\\n**Conclusion**: This is **standard practice** for skills in this codebase. Skills point to directories containing SKILL.md, not the markdown files directly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Best Practices Assessment\\n\\n### ✅ Follows Best Practices\\n1. **Semantic versioning**: 1.29.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)\\n2. **Descriptive keywords**: 41 comprehensive tags\\n3. **Full author metadata**: Name, email, company\\n4. **Explicit dependencies**: Declares multimodel dependency with version constraint\\n5. **Compatibility declaration**: Claude Code version specified\\n6. **Relative paths**: Uses `./` prefix for all component paths\\n7. **Output styles**: Declares custom output formatting\\n8. **MCP integration**: Points to .mcp.json for server configuration\\n\\n### ⚠️ Deviations from Best Practices\\n1. **No hooks declaration**: Despite having hooks infrastructure\\n2. **Incomplete command declarations**: Missing recently added command\\n3. **Version string in description**: Redundant with version field (but useful for users)\\n4. **Skill count in description**: Manual counter prone to drift (currently off by 1-2)\\n\\n### 📊 Comparison with Other Plugins\\n\\n| Feature | dev | multimodel | code-analysis | frontend |\\n|---------|-----|------------|---------------|----------|\\n| Hooks declared | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\\n| All components listed | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\\n| Version in description | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\\n| Component count in desc | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n| Output styles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\\n\\n**Pattern**: Frontend also lacks hooks declaration, suggesting this may be a recent feature not yet universally adopted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Findings\\n\\n### Finding 1: Hooks Infrastructure Not Activated\\n**Evidence**:\\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` contains full hook configuration\\n- File defines PreToolUse hooks for TaskUpdate tool\\n- File defines PostToolUse hooks for Write tool\\n- References enforcement scripts in `scripts/` directory\\n- **plugin.json has no `\\\"hooks\\\"` field**\\n\\n**Root Cause**: Manifest not updated after adding enforcement system\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n```json\\n\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Standard pattern uses `hooks.json`, but dev plugin uses `feature-enforcement.json`. Code-analysis plugin structure:\\n```\\nhooks/\\n  hooks.json (main config)\\n  enrichment-preread.sh\\n  enrichment-postread.sh\\n```\\n\\nDev plugin could:\\n1. Rename to `hooks/hooks.json` (standard)\\n2. Keep as is, reference correctly (also valid)\\n\\n**Recommendation**: Reference existing file: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"`\\n\\n### Finding 2: Missing Command Declaration\\n**Evidence**:\\n- File exists: `commands/delegate.md`\\n- Added 2026-02-10 (per MEMORY.md)\\n- Purpose: On-demand delegation routing with task-routing skill\\n- **Not in plugin.json commands array**\\n\\n**Impact**: Command may not be indexed by Claude Code's plugin system\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n```json\\n\\\"commands\\\": [\\n  \\\"./commands/help.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/implement.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/debug.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/feature.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/architect.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/brainstorm.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/ui.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/create-style.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/interview.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/deep-research.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/doc.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/learn.md\\\",\\n  \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"  // ADD THIS\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Finding 3: Skill Count Discrepancy\\n**Evidence**:\\n- Description: \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n- Plugin.json skills array: 44 entries\\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\\n\\n**Known missing**:\\n- `task-routing` skill (added 2026-02-10, pairs with delegate command)\\n\\n**Other potential missing**: One unidentified skill (46 - 44 - 1 = 1)\\n\\n**Fix Required**:\\n1. Add task-routing to skills array:\\n```json\\n\\\"skills\\\": [\\n  // ... existing entries ...\\n  \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n2. Verify the 46th skill by checking all directories:\\n```bash\\nfind plugins/dev/skills -name \\\"SKILL.md\\\" -exec dirname {} \\\\;\\n```\\n\\n3. Update description to match reality (likely \\\"46 skills\\\" or \\\"45 skills\\\" after verification)\\n\\n### Finding 4: Output Styles - Rare Feature Usage\\n**Observation**: Only dev plugin declares output styles in this codebase\\n\\n**Evidence**:\\n- dev: `\\\"outputStyles\\\": [\\\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\\\"]`\\n- multimodel: No outputStyles field\\n- code-analysis: No outputStyles field\\n- frontend: No outputStyles field\\n\\n**Assessment**: This is **GOOD**, not an issue. Output styles are a valid but rarely-used plugin feature. Dev plugin using this shows advanced feature adoption.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Blocking)\\n1. **Add hooks declaration**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Without this, enforcement system is dead code.\\n\\n2. **Add delegate.md to commands array**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Otherwise command may not load correctly.\\n\\n### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Quality)\\n3. **Add task-routing to skills array**:\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./skills/task-routing\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Audit all skill directories and update count**:\\n   - Verify 46 SKILL.md files against 44 declared paths\\n   - Update description string to match (\\\"46 skills\\\" or confirm 45)\\n\\n### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Polish)\\n5. **Consider standardizing hooks filename**:\\n   - Current: `feature-enforcement.json`\\n   - Standard: `hooks.json`\\n   - Both work, but consistency helps maintainability\\n\\n6. **Add categories/tags for skill bundles**:\\n   - multimodel plugin uses `skillBundles` field\\n   - Helps organize 45+ skills for discoverability\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound but operationally incomplete**. The schema is correct, version tracking is excellent, and most components are properly declared. However, the missing hooks declaration is a **critical issue** that prevents the enforcement system from functioning.\\n\\nThe plugin demonstrates advanced feature usage (output styles, comprehensive keywords, dependencies) but fell behind in maintenance during recent additions (delegate command, task-routing skill).\\n\\n**Overall Assessment**: 85/100\\n- Schema: 95/100 (excellent structure)\\n- Completeness: 70/100 (missing 3+ components)\\n- Consistency: 100/100 (version alignment perfect)\\n- Best practices: 80/100 (follows most patterns)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Missing critical hooks declaration prevents enforcement system from loading; also missing recent command/skill declarations\\nKEY_ISSUES: No hooks field for feature-enforcement.json, delegate.md command not declared, task-routing skill not declared, skill count mismatch (44 declared vs 46 actual)\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":911,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":28651,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":911,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyheX4mrGeQgNkvQ857D\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.913Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"uuid\":\"e7165761-9c86-4051-8746-42453d6ec096\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"e7165761-9c86-4051-8746-42453d6ec096\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"uuid\":\"e447950f-81e8-4c4d-8ebb-ac3adff7e69a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"08789be9-6a91-40e8-a28c-44979dce83d0\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a7ab257\",\"slug\":\"wise-herding-panda\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MJcxoDeAxo2Uy9QvWP29uk\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-144526-a499ee57/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"f02e5910-1a6a-4d59-af2a-02f466919534\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:47:15.918Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"10631438-5c9c-4e8c-b4d0-7cf28f6fbbf8\"}\n"}}}

Skills point to directories containing SKILL.md, not the markdown files directly.\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices Assessment\n\n### ✅ Follows Best Practices\n1. **Semantic versioning**: 1.29.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)\n2. **Descriptive keywords**: 41 comprehensive tags\n3. **Full author metadata**: Name, email, company\n4. **Explicit dependencies**: Declares multimodel dependency with version constraint\n5. **Compatibility declaration**: Claude Code version specified\n6. **Relative paths**: Uses `./` prefix for all component paths\n7. **Output styles**: Declares custom output formatting\n8. **MCP integration**: Points to .mcp.json for server configuration\n\n### ⚠️ Deviations from Best Practices\n1. **No hooks declaration**: Despite having hooks infrastructure\n2. **Incomplete command declarations**: Missing recently added command\n3. **Version string in description**: Redundant with version field (but useful for users)\n4. **Skill count in description**: Manual counter prone to drift (currently off by 1-2)\n\n### 📊 Comparison with Other Plugins\n\n| Feature | dev | multimodel | code-analysis | frontend |\n|---------|-----|------------|---------------|----------|\n| Hooks declared | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| All components listed | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Version in description | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| Component count in desc | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| Output styles | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n\n**Pattern**: Frontend also lacks hooks declaration, suggesting this may be a recent feature not yet universally adopted.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Finding 1: Hooks Infrastructure Not Activated\n**Evidence**:\n- `hooks/feature-enforcement.json` contains full hook configuration\n- File defines PreToolUse hooks for TaskUpdate tool\n- File defines PostToolUse hooks for Write tool\n- References enforcement scripts in `scripts/` directory\n- **plugin.json has no `\"hooks\"` field**\n\n**Root Cause**: Manifest not updated after adding enforcement system\n\n**Fix Required**:\n```json\n\"hooks\": \"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\"\n```\n\n**Note**: Standard pattern uses `hooks.json`, but dev plugin uses `feature-enforcement.json`. Code-analysis plugin structure:\n```\nhooks/\n  hooks.json (main config)\n  enrichment-preread.sh\n  enrichment-postread.sh\n```\n\nDev plugin could:\n1. Rename to `hooks/hooks.json` (standard)\n2. Keep as is, reference correctly (also valid)\n\n**Recommendation**: Reference existing file: `\"hooks\": \"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\"`\n\n### Finding 2: Missing Command Declaration\n**Evidence**:\n- File exists: `commands/delegate.md`\n- Added 2026-02-10 (per MEMORY.md)\n- Purpose: On-demand delegation routing with task-routing skill\n- **Not in plugin.json commands array**\n\n**Impact**: Command may not be indexed by Claude Code's plugin system\n\n**Fix Required**:\n```json\n\"commands\": [\n  \"./commands/help.md\",\n  \"./commands/implement.md\",\n  \"./commands/debug.md\",\n  \"./commands/feature.md\",\n  \"./commands/architect.md\",\n  \"./commands/brainstorm.md\",\n  \"./commands/ui.md\",\n  \"./commands/create-style.md\",\n  \"./commands/interview.md\",\n  \"./commands/deep-research.md\",\n  \"./commands/doc.md\",\n  \"./commands/learn.md\",\n  \"./commands/delegate.md\"  // ADD THIS\n]\n```\n\n### Finding 3: Skill Count Discrepancy\n**Evidence**:\n- Description: \"45 skills\"\n- Plugin.json skills array: 44 entries\n- Actual SKILL.md files: 46\n\n**Known missing**:\n- `task-routing` skill (added 2026-02-10, pairs with delegate command)\n\n**Other potential missing**: One unidentified skill (46 - 44 - 1 = 1)\n\n**Fix Required**:\n1. Add task-routing to skills array:\n```json\n\"skills\": [\n  // ... existing entries ...\n  \"./skills/task-routing\"\n]\n```\n\n2. Verify the 46th skill by checking all directories:\n```bash\nfind plugins/dev/skills -name \"SKILL.md\" -exec dirname {} \\;\n```\n\n3. Update description to match reality (likely \"46 skills\" or \"45 skills\" after verification)\n\n### Finding 4: Output Styles - Rare Feature Usage\n**Observation**: Only dev plugin declares output styles in this codebase\n\n**Evidence**:\n- dev: `\"outputStyles\": [\"./output-styles/self-improving.md\"]`\n- multimodel: No outputStyles field\n- code-analysis: No outputStyles field\n- frontend: No outputStyles field\n\n**Assessment**: This is **GOOD**, not an issue. Output styles are a valid but rarely-used plugin feature. Dev plugin using this shows advanced feature adoption.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Priority 1: MUST FIX (Blocking)\n1. **Add hooks declaration**:\n   ```json\n   \"hooks\": \"./hooks/feature-enforcement.json\"\n   ```\n   Without this, enforcement system is dead code.\n\n2. **Add delegate.md to commands array**:\n   ```json\n   \"./commands/delegate.md\"\n   ```\n   Otherwise command may not load correctly.\n\n### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX (Quality)\n3. **Add task-routing to skills array**:\n   ```json\n   \"./skills/task-routing\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Audit all skill directories and update count**:\n   - Verify 46 SKILL.md files against 44 declared paths\n   - Update description string to match (\"46 skills\" or confirm 45)\n\n### Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE (Polish)\n5. **Consider standardizing hooks filename**:\n   - Current: `feature-enforcement.json`\n   - Standard: `hooks.json`\n   - Both work, but consistency helps maintainability\n\n6. **Add categories/tags for skill bundles**:\n   - multimodel plugin uses `skillBundles` field\n   - Helps organize 45+ skills for discoverability\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound but operationally incomplete**. The schema is correct, version tracking is excellent, and most components are properly declared. However, the missing hooks declaration is a **critical issue** that prevents the enforcement system from functioning.\n\nThe plugin demonstrates advanced feature usage (output styles, comprehensive keywords, dependencies) but fell behind in maintenance during recent additions (delegate command, task-routing skill).\n\n**Overall Assessment**: 85/100\n- Schema: 95/100 (excellent structure)\n- Completeness: 70/100 (missing 3+ components)\n- Consistency: 100/100 (version alignment perfect)\n- Best practices: 80/100 (follows most patterns)\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: REJECT\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nSUMMARY: Missing critical hooks declaration prevents enforcement system from loading; also missing recent command/skill declarations\nKEY_ISSUES: No hooks field for feature-enforcement.json, delegate.md command not declared, task-routing skill not declared, skill count mismatch (44 declared vs 46 actual)\n```\n","numLines":352,"startLine":1,"totalLines":352}}}
