Bun Backend Plugin ❌ MISMATCH\\n\\n| Location | Version | Status |\\n|----------|---------|--------|\\n| `plugins/bun/plugin.json` | **1.6.0** | ✅ |\\n| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | NOT LISTED | ❌ MISSING |\\n| `CLAUDE.md` (Line 20) | **v1.5.2** | ❌ OUTDATED |\\n| `CLAUDE.md` (Line 218) | **v1.5.2** | ❌ OUTDATED |\\n\\n**Issues:**\\n- Bun plugin is **COMPLETELY MISSING** from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n- CLAUDE.md table shows v1.5.2 instead of v1.6.0\\n- \\\"Current Versions\\\" section shows v1.5.2 instead of v1.6.0\\n- Git tag reference shows v1.5.2 (line 237)\\n\\n**CRITICAL:** This plugin won't be available through claudeup at all!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Summary Statistics\\n\\n| Metric | Count |\\n|--------|-------|\\n| Total Plugins Analyzed | 10 |\\n| Fully Consistent | 0 |\\n| Marketplace + plugin.json Consistent | 8 |\\n| CLAUDE.md Outdated | 10 |\\n| Missing from Marketplace | 2 (frontend, bun) |\\n| Plugins with 3+ Location Mismatches | 8 |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues\\n\\n### 1. Missing Marketplace Entries (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\\n- **Frontend Plugin (3.14.0)**: Not in marketplace.json at all\\n- **Bun Backend Plugin (1.6.0)**: Not in marketplace.json at all\\n\\nThese plugins are completely unavailable through claudeup, violating the release checklist requirement.\\n\\n### 2. CLAUDE.md Documentation Drift (HIGH PRIORITY)\\nAll 10 plugins have outdated version references in CLAUDE.md:\\n- Main table (lines 16-26) is outdated for 9 plugins\\n- \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224) is outdated for 8 plugins\\n- Git Tags section (lines 234-244) is outdated for 8 plugins\\n- Conductor plugin missing from main table entirely\\n\\n### 3. Documentation Maintenance Pattern\\nThe fact that:\\n- plugin.json and marketplace.json are mostly in sync (8/10)\\n- BUT CLAUDE.md is universally outdated\\n\\n...suggests that the documentation update step is being skipped during releases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries:**\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"frontend\\\",\\n     \\\"version\\\": \\\"3.14.0\\\",\\n     ...\\n   }\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"bun\\\",\\n     \\\"version\\\": \\\"1.6.0\\\",\\n     ...\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md with current versions:**\\n   - Line 18: Frontend v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\\n   - Line 19: Code Analysis v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\\n   - Line 20: Bun v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\\n   - Line 21: Orchestration v0.8.2 → Multimodel v2.2.0\\n   - Line 22: Agent Development v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\\n   - Line 23: SEO v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\\n   - Line 24: Video Editing v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\\n   - Line 25: Nanobanana v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\\n   - Line 26: Dev v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\\n   - Add Conductor to table\\n\\n3. **Update \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224):**\\n   - All 10 plugins need version updates to match plugin.json\\n\\n4. **Update Git Tags section (lines 234-244):**\\n   - Update all tag references to match current versions\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Automated version checking script:**\\n   Create a pre-commit hook or CI check that validates:\\n   - plugin.json version\\n   - marketplace.json version\\n   - CLAUDE.md table version\\n   - CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" version\\n   - Git tag reference\\n\\n2. **Single source of truth:**\\n   Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from plugin.json files automatically\\n\\n3. **Release checklist enforcement:**\\n   The existing release checklist mentions \\\"ALL 3 REQUIRED\\\" but CLAUDE.md isn't enforced\\n   - Add CLAUDE.md as explicit 4th requirement\\n   - Add validation script to release workflow\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Evidence\\n\\n### Source Files Examined\\n1. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Read)\\n2. ✅

Missing Marketplace Entries (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\\n- **Frontend Plugin (3.14.0)**: Not in marketplace.json at all\\n- **Bun Backend Plugin (1.6.0)**: Not in marketplace.json at all\\n\\nThese plugins are completely unavailable through claudeup, violating the release checklist requirement.\\n\\n### 2. CLAUDE.md Documentation Drift (HIGH PRIORITY)\\nAll 10 plugins have outdated version references in CLAUDE.md:\\n- Main table (lines 16-26) is outdated for 9 plugins\\n- \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224) is outdated for 8 plugins\\n- Git Tags section (lines 234-244) is outdated for 8 plugins\\n- Conductor plugin missing from main table entirely\\n\\n### 3. Documentation Maintenance Pattern\\nThe fact that:\\n- plugin.json and marketplace.json are mostly in sync (8/10)\\n- BUT CLAUDE.md is universally outdated\\n\\n...suggests that the documentation update step is being skipped during releases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries:**\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"frontend\\\",\\n     \\\"version\\\": \\\"3.14.0\\\",\\n     ...\\n   }\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"bun\\\",\\n     \\\"version\\\": \\\"1.6.0\\\",\\n     ...\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md with current versions:**\\n   - Line 18: Frontend v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\\n   - Line 19: Code Analysis v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\\n   - Line 20: Bun v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\\n   - Line 21: Orchestration v0.8.2 → Multimodel v2.2.0\\n   - Line 22: Agent Development v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\\n   - Line 23: SEO v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\\n   - Line 24: Video Editing v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\\n   - Line 25: Nanobanana v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\\n   - Line 26: Dev v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\\n   - Add Conductor to table\\n\\n3. **Update \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224):**\\n   - All 10 plugins need version updates to match plugin.json\\n\\n4. **Update Git Tags section (lines 234-244):**\\n   - Update all tag references to match current versions\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Automated version checking script:**\\n   Create a pre-commit hook or CI check that validates:\\n   - plugin.json version\\n   - marketplace.json version\\n   - CLAUDE.md table version\\n   - CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" version\\n   - Git tag reference\\n\\n2. **Single source of truth:**\\n   Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from plugin.json files automatically\\n\\n3. **Release checklist enforcement:**\\n   The existing release checklist mentions \\\"ALL 3 REQUIRED\\\" but CLAUDE.md isn't enforced\\n   - Add CLAUDE.md as explicit 4th requirement\\n   - Add validation script to release workflow\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Evidence\\n\\n### Source Files Examined\\n1. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Read)\\n2. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` (Read)\\n3. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/code-analysis/plugin.json` (Read)\\n4. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/multimodel/plugin.json` (Read)\\n5. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/agentdev/plugin.json` (Read)\\n6. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/seo/plugin.json` (Read)\\n7. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/video-editing/plugin.json` (Read)\\n8. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/nanobanana/plugin.json` (Read)\\n9. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/conductor/plugin.json` (Read)\\n10. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/plugin.json` (Read)\\n11. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/frontend/plugin.json` (Read)\\n12. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/bun/plugin.json` (Read)\\n\\n### Analysis Method\\n- Direct file reading with Read tool\\n- Manual cross-reference comparison\\n- Line-by-line verification of all three sources\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 8/10 plugins have version inconsistencies, 2 plugins completely missing from marketplace.json, CLAUDE.md universally outdated\\nKEY_ISSUES: Frontend plugin missing from marketplace, Bun plugin missing from marketplace, All 10 plugins have outdated CLAUDE.md documentation, Version drift across all three required locations\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8739,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":26809,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8739,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyihG3ajZCoBJ4hJifLG\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.669Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"8f8ce210-7f48-4fcc-b6ff-d31de74f4889\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9a8465\",\"slug\":\"graceful-gathering-hamster\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.675Z\",\"uuid\":\"e7037e86-9789-4d05-b9a6-d57d519f4c3b\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"e7037e86-9789-4d05-b9a6-d57d519f4c3b\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"8f8ce210-7f48-4fcc-b6ff-d31de74f4889\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9a8465\",\"slug\":\"graceful-gathering-hamster\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.675Z\",\"uuid\":\"4894ab58-60bd-4c6c-a342-c383f0ca5a1a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"8f8ce210-7f48-4fcc-b6ff-d31de74f4889\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9a8465\",\"slug\":\"graceful-gathering-hamster\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-145913-da37711a/gemini-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"c46a9c64-cbda-44c0-9313-e05595d87235\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.674Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: google/gemini-3-pro-preview\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nCheck plugin version numbers in this repository.

Missing Marketplace Entries (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\\n- **Frontend Plugin (3.14.0)**: Not in marketplace.json at all\\n- **Bun Backend Plugin (1.6.0)**: Not in marketplace.json at all\\n\\nThese plugins are completely unavailable through claudeup, violating the release checklist requirement.\\n\\n### 2. CLAUDE.md Documentation Drift (HIGH PRIORITY)\\nAll 10 plugins have outdated version references in CLAUDE.md:\\n- Main table (lines 16-26) is outdated for 9 plugins\\n- \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224) is outdated for 8 plugins\\n- Git Tags section (lines 234-244) is outdated for 8 plugins\\n- Conductor plugin missing from main table entirely\\n\\n### 3. Documentation Maintenance Pattern\\nThe fact that:\\n- plugin.json and marketplace.json are mostly in sync (8/10)\\n- BUT CLAUDE.md is universally outdated\\n\\n...suggests that the documentation update step is being skipped during releases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries:**\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"frontend\\\",\\n     \\\"version\\\": \\\"3.14.0\\\",\\n     ...\\n   }\\n   {\\n     \\\"name\\\": \\\"bun\\\",\\n     \\\"version\\\": \\\"1.6.0\\\",\\n     ...\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md with current versions:**\\n   - Line 18: Frontend v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\\n   - Line 19: Code Analysis v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\\n   - Line 20: Bun v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\\n   - Line 21: Orchestration v0.8.2 → Multimodel v2.2.0\\n   - Line 22: Agent Development v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\\n   - Line 23: SEO v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\\n   - Line 24: Video Editing v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\\n   - Line 25: Nanobanana v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\\n   - Line 26: Dev v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\\n   - Add Conductor to table\\n\\n3. **Update \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224):**\\n   - All 10 plugins need version updates to match plugin.json\\n\\n4. **Update Git Tags section (lines 234-244):**\\n   - Update all tag references to match current versions\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Automated version checking script:**\\n   Create a pre-commit hook or CI check that validates:\\n   - plugin.json version\\n   - marketplace.json version\\n   - CLAUDE.md table version\\n   - CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" version\\n   - Git tag reference\\n\\n2. **Single source of truth:**\\n   Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from plugin.json files automatically\\n\\n3. **Release checklist enforcement:**\\n   The existing release checklist mentions \\\"ALL 3 REQUIRED\\\" but CLAUDE.md isn't enforced\\n   - Add CLAUDE.md as explicit 4th requirement\\n   - Add validation script to release workflow\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Evidence\\n\\n### Source Files Examined\\n1. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Read)\\n2. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` (Read)\\n3. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/code-analysis/plugin.json` (Read)\\n4. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/multimodel/plugin.json` (Read)\\n5. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/agentdev/plugin.json` (Read)\\n6. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/seo/plugin.json` (Read)\\n7. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/video-editing/plugin.json` (Read)\\n8. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/nanobanana/plugin.json` (Read)\\n9. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/conductor/plugin.json` (Read)\\n10. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/plugin.json` (Read)\\n11. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/frontend/plugin.json` (Read)\\n12. ✅ `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/bun/plugin.json` (Read)\\n\\n### Analysis Method\\n- Direct file reading with Read tool\\n- Manual cross-reference comparison\\n- Line-by-line verification of all three sources\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 8/10 plugins have version inconsistencies, 2 plugins completely missing from marketplace.json, CLAUDE.md universally outdated\\nKEY_ISSUES: Frontend plugin missing from marketplace, Bun plugin missing from marketplace, All 10 plugins have outdated CLAUDE.md documentation, Version drift across all three required locations\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8739,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":26809,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8739,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyihG3ajZCoBJ4hJifLG\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.669Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"8f8ce210-7f48-4fcc-b6ff-d31de74f4889\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9a8465\",\"slug\":\"graceful-gathering-hamster\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.675Z\",\"uuid\":\"e7037e86-9789-4d05-b9a6-d57d519f4c3b\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"e7037e86-9789-4d05-b9a6-d57d519f4c3b\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"8f8ce210-7f48-4fcc-b6ff-d31de74f4889\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9a8465\",\"slug\":\"graceful-gathering-hamster\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.675Z\",\"uuid\":\"4894ab58-60bd-4c6c-a342-c383f0ca5a1a\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"8f8ce210-7f48-4fcc-b6ff-d31de74f4889\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9a8465\",\"slug\":\"graceful-gathering-hamster\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01RqMntygUn7aV697AtMUKQP\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-145913-da37711a/gemini-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"c46a9c64-cbda-44c0-9313-e05595d87235\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T04:00:38.674Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"3095669b-b40c-4800-a1a2-bca8921eca91\"}\n"}}}
