Summary Statistics\\n\\n| Category | Count |\\n|----------|-------|\\n| Total plugin directories | 13 |\\n| Valid plugins (with plugin.json) | 12 |\\n| Plugins in marketplace.json | 8 |\\n| Plugins in CLAUDE.md | 9 |\\n| **Version mismatches (CLAUDE.md)** | **9** |\\n| Plugins missing from marketplace | 4 |\\n| Incomplete plugins (no plugin.json) | 1 (go) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Root Cause Analysis\\n\\n### Primary Issues\\n\\n1. **CLAUDE.md is systematically outdated** - 9 out of 12 plugins have version mismatches\\n2. **Marketplace incomplete** - 4 plugins missing from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n3. **Inconsistent release process** - plugin.json and marketplace.json are updated, but CLAUDE.md is forgotten\\n\\n### Pattern Observed\\n\\nThe pattern shows:\\n- `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` are kept **in sync** (8/8 match)\\n- `CLAUDE.md` is consistently **not updated** during releases\\n- This violates the documented release checklist in CLAUDE.md itself\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Assessment\\n\\n### High Impact\\n- **Users reading CLAUDE.md will see wrong version numbers** - creates confusion\\n- **Release checklist in CLAUDE.md is not being followed** - process failure\\n- **4 plugins not in marketplace** - users cannot discover/install them via claudeup\\n\\n### Medium Impact\\n- **Git tags may also be outdated** - need verification (not checked in this analysis)\\n- **Version history tracking is unreliable** - documentation drift\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Update CLAUDE.md versions for all 9 outdated plugins:**\\n   - code-analysis: 3.0.0 → 3.2.0\\n   - agentdev: 1.3.0 → 1.5.0\\n   - seo: 1.5.1 → 1.6.0\\n   - video-editing: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0\\n   - nanobanana: 2.2.3 → 2.3.0\\n   - conductor: 2.0.1 → 2.1.0\\n   - multimodel: 2.0.0 → 2.2.0\\n   - frontend: 3.13.0 → 3.14.0\\n   - bun: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0\\n\\n2. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json:**\\n   - frontend (v3.14.0)\\n   - bun (v1.6.0)\\n   - autopilot (v0.2.0) - if ready for release\\n   - instantly (v1.0.1) - if ready for release\\n\\n3. **Add missing plugins to CLAUDE.md:**\\n   - autopilot (v0.2.0)\\n   - instantly (v1.0.1)\\n\\n4. **Investigate the `go` plugin:**\\n   - Directory exists but no plugin.json\\n   - Either complete it or remove the directory\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Enforce the 3-step release checklist** documented in CLAUDE.md:\\n   - Update plugin.json\\n   - Update marketplace.json\\n   - Update CLAUDE.md\\n   - Create git tag\\n\\n2. **Add automation:**\\n   - Script to detect version mismatches\\n   - Pre-release validation hook\\n   - CI/CD check that fails if versions don't match\\n\\n3. **Single source of truth:**\\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md plugin table from marketplace.json\\n   - Or add a validation test to CI/CD\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vote\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 9 out of 12

Summary Statistics\\n\\n| Category | Count |\\n|----------|-------|\\n| Total plugin directories | 13 |\\n| Valid plugins (with plugin.json) | 12 |\\n| Plugins in marketplace.json | 8 |\\n| Plugins in CLAUDE.md | 9 |\\n| **Version mismatches (CLAUDE.md)** | **9** |\\n| Plugins missing from marketplace | 4 |\\n| Incomplete plugins (no plugin.json) | 1 (go) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Root Cause Analysis\\n\\n### Primary Issues\\n\\n1. **CLAUDE.md is systematically outdated** - 9 out of 12 plugins have version mismatches\\n2. **Marketplace incomplete** - 4 plugins missing from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n3. **Inconsistent release process** - plugin.json and marketplace.json are updated, but CLAUDE.md is forgotten\\n\\n### Pattern Observed\\n\\nThe pattern shows:\\n- `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` are kept **in sync** (8/8 match)\\n- `CLAUDE.md` is consistently **not updated** during releases\\n- This violates the documented release checklist in CLAUDE.md itself\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Assessment\\n\\n### High Impact\\n- **Users reading CLAUDE.md will see wrong version numbers** - creates confusion\\n- **Release checklist in CLAUDE.md is not being followed** - process failure\\n- **4 plugins not in marketplace** - users cannot discover/install them via claudeup\\n\\n### Medium Impact\\n- **Git tags may also be outdated** - need verification (not checked in this analysis)\\n- **Version history tracking is unreliable** - documentation drift\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Update CLAUDE.md versions for all 9 outdated plugins:**\\n   - code-analysis: 3.0.0 → 3.2.0\\n   - agentdev: 1.3.0 → 1.5.0\\n   - seo: 1.5.1 → 1.6.0\\n   - video-editing: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0\\n   - nanobanana: 2.2.3 → 2.3.0\\n   - conductor: 2.0.1 → 2.1.0\\n   - multimodel: 2.0.0 → 2.2.0\\n   - frontend: 3.13.0 → 3.14.0\\n   - bun: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0\\n\\n2. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json:**\\n   - frontend (v3.14.0)\\n   - bun (v1.6.0)\\n   - autopilot (v0.2.0) - if ready for release\\n   - instantly (v1.0.1) - if ready for release\\n\\n3. **Add missing plugins to CLAUDE.md:**\\n   - autopilot (v0.2.0)\\n   - instantly (v1.0.1)\\n\\n4. **Investigate the `go` plugin:**\\n   - Directory exists but no plugin.json\\n   - Either complete it or remove the directory\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Enforce the 3-step release checklist** documented in CLAUDE.md:\\n   - Update plugin.json\\n   - Update marketplace.json\\n   - Update CLAUDE.md\\n   - Create git tag\\n\\n2. **Add automation:**\\n   - Script to detect version mismatches\\n   - Pre-release validation hook\\n   - CI/CD check that fails if versions don't match\\n\\n3. **Single source of truth:**\\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md plugin table from marketplace.json\\n   - Or add a validation test to CI/CD\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vote\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 9 out of 12

Summary Statistics\\n\\n| Category | Count |\\n|----------|-------|\\n| Total plugin directories | 13 |\\n| Valid plugins (with plugin.json) | 12 |\\n| Plugins in marketplace.json | 8 |\\n| Plugins in CLAUDE.md | 9 |\\n| **Version mismatches (CLAUDE.md)** | **9** |\\n| Plugins missing from marketplace | 4 |\\n| Incomplete plugins (no plugin.json) | 1 (go) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Root Cause Analysis\\n\\n### Primary Issues\\n\\n1. **CLAUDE.md is systematically outdated** - 9 out of 12 plugins have version mismatches\\n2. **Marketplace incomplete** - 4 plugins missing from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n3. **Inconsistent release process** - plugin.json and marketplace.json are updated, but CLAUDE.md is forgotten\\n\\n### Pattern Observed\\n\\nThe pattern shows:\\n- `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` are kept **in sync** (8/8 match)\\n- `CLAUDE.md` is consistently **not updated** during releases\\n- This violates the documented release checklist in CLAUDE.md itself\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Assessment\\n\\n### High Impact\\n- **Users reading CLAUDE.md will see wrong version numbers** - creates confusion\\n- **Release checklist in CLAUDE.md is not being followed** - process failure\\n- **4 plugins not in marketplace** - users cannot discover/install them via claudeup\\n\\n### Medium Impact\\n- **Git tags may also be outdated** - need verification (not checked in this analysis)\\n- **Version history tracking is unreliable** - documentation drift\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Update CLAUDE.md versions for all 9 outdated plugins:**\\n   - code-analysis: 3.0.0 → 3.2.0\\n   - agentdev: 1.3.0 → 1.5.0\\n   - seo: 1.5.1 → 1.6.0\\n   - video-editing: 1.0.1 → 1.1.0\\n   - nanobanana: 2.2.3 → 2.3.0\\n   - conductor: 2.0.1 → 2.1.0\\n   - multimodel: 2.0.0 → 2.2.0\\n   - frontend: 3.13.0 → 3.14.0\\n   - bun: 1.5.2 → 1.6.0\\n\\n2. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json:**\\n   - frontend (v3.14.0)\\n   - bun (v1.6.0)\\n   - autopilot (v0.2.0) - if ready for release\\n   - instantly (v1.0.1) - if ready for release\\n\\n3. **Add missing plugins to CLAUDE.md:**\\n   - autopilot (v0.2.0)\\n   - instantly (v1.0.1)\\n\\n4. **Investigate the `go` plugin:**\\n   - Directory exists but no plugin.json\\n   - Either complete it or remove the directory\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Enforce the 3-step release checklist** documented in CLAUDE.md:\\n   - Update plugin.json\\n   - Update marketplace.json\\n   - Update CLAUDE.md\\n   - Create git tag\\n\\n2. **Add automation:**\\n   - Script to detect version mismatches\\n   - Pre-release validation hook\\n   - CI/CD check that fails if versions don't match\\n\\n3. **Single source of truth:**\\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md plugin table from marketplace.json\\n   - Or add a validation test to CI/CD\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vote\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 9 out of 12
