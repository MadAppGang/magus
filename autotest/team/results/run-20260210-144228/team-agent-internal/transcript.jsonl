PASS\\n\\nAll essential Claude Code plugin fields are present and correctly formatted:\\n\\n- **name**: `\\\"dev\\\"` - Valid plugin identifier\\n- **version**: `\\\"1.29.0\\\"` - Semantic versioning, matches marketplace.json\\n- **description**: Clear, version-specific, feature-focused\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, company\\n- **license**: `\\\"MIT\\\"` - Standard open-source license\\n- **keywords**: Comprehensive (42 keywords covering all capabilities)\\n- **category**: `\\\"development\\\"` - Appropriate classification\\n- **compatibility**: `\\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"` - Version constraint present\\n\\n### ✅ Component Declarations - STRUCTURE VALID\\n\\nComponent arrays follow correct plugin system format:\\n\\n- **agents**: Array of 15 relative paths (`./agents/*.md`)\\n- **commands**: Array of 12 relative paths (`./commands/*.md`)\\n- **skills**: Array of 44 relative paths (`./skills/*`)\\n- **outputStyles**: Array of 1 relative path (`./output-styles/*.md`)\\n- **mcpServers**: String path to config file (`\\\"./.mcp.json\\\"`)\\n\\nAll paths use correct `./` prefix for plugin-relative references.\\n\\n### ✅ Dependencies - CORRECT\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- Dependency on multimodel plugin correctly declared\\n- Version constraint uses caret (^) for compatible updates\\n- Format matches Claude Code plugin system requirements\\n\\n### ✅ MCP Configuration - VALID\\n\\nReferenced file `.mcp.json` exists and contains valid MCP server configuration:\\n- `claudish` MCP server properly configured\\n- Environment variable reference `${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}` correct\\n- Command and args structure valid\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUE #1: Missing Agent Declaration\\n\\n**File exists but NOT declared in plugin.json:**\\n- `agents/test-architect.md` (exists on disk, not in agents array)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Agent is not discoverable by Claude Code\\n- Task delegation to `dev:test-architect` will fail\\n- User documentation may reference unavailable agent\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n```bash\\n# Agents on disk: 16 files\\n# Agents in plugin.json: 15 declarations\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Add `\\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"` to the `agents` array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUE #2: Missing Command Declaration\\n\\n**File exists but NOT declared in plugin.json:**\\n- `commands/delegate.md` (exists on disk, not in commands array)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Command is not registered with Claude Code\\n- Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` or `/delegate`\\n- Recent feature addition (referenced in CLAUDE.md Task Routing section) is inaccessible\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n```bash\\n# Commands on disk: 13 files\\n# Commands in plugin.json: 12 declarations\\n```\\n\\n**Context from CLAUDE.md:**\\n> `/dev:delegate` command: On-demand delegation command (skills: dev:task-routing)\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to the `commands` array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ⚠️ ISSUE #3: Inaccurate Skills Count in Description\\n\\n**Current description claims:**\\n> \\\"45 skills.\\\"\\n\\n**Actual count:**\\n- **Declared in plugin.json:** 44 skill paths\\n- **SKILL.md files on disk:** 46 files\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\nThe description claims 45 skills, but the plugin.json declares 44. There are 46 actual SKILL.md files on disk, meaning 2 skills exist but aren't declared.\\n\\n**Discrepancy breakdown:**\\n- Plugin.json declares category paths (e.g., `./skills/frontend/react-typescript`)\\n- Disk has additional skills not declared (likely `task-routing` and one other)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Minor: Misleading documentation\\n- Users may expect different skill count\\n- Skill discovery may miss undeclared skills\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n1. Verify all skill directories with SKILL.md files are declared\\n2. Update description to match actual declared count\\n3. Consider adding missing skill declarations\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Against Conventions\\n\\n### ✅ Path Format\\n- All component paths use `./` prefix ✓\\n- Relative to plugin root ✓\\n- No absolute paths ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Naming Convention\\n- Plugin name is lowercase, no special characters ✓\\n- Component files use kebab-case ✓\\n- Agent/command/skill file extensions are `.md` ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Version Consistency\\n- Plugin version `1.29.0` matches marketplace.json ✓\\n- Semantic versioning format ✓\\n- Version mentioned in description ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Metadata Quality\\n- Description is informative and version-specific ✓\\n- Keywords are relevant and comprehensive ✓\\n- Author information complete ✓\\n- Category appropriate for plugin type ✓\\n\\n### ❌ Component Completeness\\n- Missing agent declaration (test-architect.md) ✗\\n- Missing command declaration (delegate.md) ✗\\n- Potential missing skill declarations ⚠️\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Cross-Reference with CLAUDE.md\\n\\nThe project's `CLAUDE.md` file references features that depend on complete declarations:\\n\\n1. **Task Routing Table** - References `dev:researcher`, `dev:developer`, etc.\\n   - ✅ All referenced agents ARE declared (except test-architect)\\n\\n2. **Subagent Selection** - References `/dev:delegate` command\\n   - ❌ Command exists but NOT declared in plugin.json\\n\\n3. **Skill Count** - Documentation claims \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n   - ⚠️ Actual declarations: 44, actual files: 46\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Well-structured JSON** - Clean formatting, valid syntax\\n2. **Comprehensive metadata** - Rich keywords, clear description\\n3. **Proper dependencies** - Multimodel plugin correctly declared\\n4. **MCP integration** - Valid claudish MCP server configuration\\n5. **Version consistency** - Matches marketplace.json exactly\\n6. **Convention adherence** - Follows plugin system standards\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Critical (Must Fix)\\n1. ✅ Add `\\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"` to agents array\\n2. ✅ Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n\\n### Important (Should Fix)\\n3. Audit all skill directories with SKILL.md files\\n4. Add missing skill declarations to plugin.json\\n5. Update description to reflect accurate skill count (44 or 46)\\n\\n### Nice-to-Have\\n6. Consider alphabetizing agent/command arrays for maintainability\\n7. Add comments (if JSON5 supported) explaining skill organization structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vote\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is sound but missing critical component declarations (test-architect agent, delegate command) that break discoverability and prevent feature usage.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing agent declaration (test-architect.md), Missing command declaration (delegate.md), Inaccurate skill count in description\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rationale for Rejection\\n\\nWhile the `plugin.json` structure follows conventions and most declarations are correct, **the missing agent and command declarations are blocking issues** that:\\n\\n1. **Break functionality** - Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` command\\n2. **Violate completeness** - Components exist but aren't registered\\n3. **Create confusion** - Documentation references unavailable features\\n4. **Fail discoverability** - Claude Code cannot find undeclared components\\n\\nThese are **not minor inconsistencies** - they represent incomplete plugin configuration that prevents legitimate features from being accessible. The issues are easily fixable (add 2 lines to arrays), but until fixed, the plugin.json does not accurately represent the plugin's capabilities.\\n\\n**Confidence level: 9/10** - Based on file system verification, cross-reference with marketplace.json, and clear evidence of missing declarations. Only reason not 10/10 is the complexity of skill directory structure which may have edge cases I haven't considered.\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":270,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":27293,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":270,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyhUQX6ZGaLcP1pxwM7Y\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.950Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"uuid\":\"34282af0-15ff-4d3f-b2e9-cdba20d775c7\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"34282af0-15ff-4d3f-b2e9-cdba20d775c7\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"uuid\":\"d27f4f6d-3d3c-4b99-b480-f4295eeffa0d\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-144244-6da028d0/internal-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"b9e3d4ad-a6c4-46fe-a72b-98c59fd6a90a\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b9e3d4ad-a6c4-46fe-a72b-98c59fd6a90a\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\"id\":\"msg_01DhLeEND2vis72tvJjEvDRo\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## Review Complete\\n\\nI've completed my independent review of `plugins/dev/plugin.json` and written the comprehensive analysis to the required file.\\n\\n**Key findings:**\\n\\n**VERDICT: REJECT**\\n\\n**Critical Issues Found:**\\n1. **Missing agent declaration**: `test-architect.md` exists on disk but is NOT declared in plugin.json (15 declared vs 16 files)\\n2. **Missing command declaration**: `delegate.md` exists on disk but is NOT declared in plugin.json (12 declared vs 13 files)\\n3. **Inaccurate skill count**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but plugin.json declares 44 (and 46 SKILL.md files exist on disk)\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- All required fields present and correct\\n- Version consistency with marketplace.json (1.29.0)\\n- Proper dependency declaration (multimodel@^2.0.0)\\n- Valid MCP configuration\\n- Follows Claude Code plugin conventions\\n- Comprehensive metadata and keywords\\n\\n**Impact:**\\nThe missing declarations break functionality - users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` command referenced in CLAUDE.md, and the test-architect agent is not discoverable.

Standard open-source license\\n- **keywords**: Comprehensive (42 keywords covering all capabilities)\\n- **category**: `\\\"development\\\"` - Appropriate classification\\n- **compatibility**: `\\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"` - Version constraint present\\n\\n### ✅ Component Declarations - STRUCTURE VALID\\n\\nComponent arrays follow correct plugin system format:\\n\\n- **agents**: Array of 15 relative paths (`./agents/*.md`)\\n- **commands**: Array of 12 relative paths (`./commands/*.md`)\\n- **skills**: Array of 44 relative paths (`./skills/*`)\\n- **outputStyles**: Array of 1 relative path (`./output-styles/*.md`)\\n- **mcpServers**: String path to config file (`\\\"./.mcp.json\\\"`)\\n\\nAll paths use correct `./` prefix for plugin-relative references.\\n\\n### ✅ Dependencies - CORRECT\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- Dependency on multimodel plugin correctly declared\\n- Version constraint uses caret (^) for compatible updates\\n- Format matches Claude Code plugin system requirements\\n\\n### ✅ MCP Configuration - VALID\\n\\nReferenced file `.mcp.json` exists and contains valid MCP server configuration:\\n- `claudish` MCP server properly configured\\n- Environment variable reference `${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}` correct\\n- Command and args structure valid\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUE #1: Missing Agent Declaration\\n\\n**File exists but NOT declared in plugin.json:**\\n- `agents/test-architect.md` (exists on disk, not in agents array)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Agent is not discoverable by Claude Code\\n- Task delegation to `dev:test-architect` will fail\\n- User documentation may reference unavailable agent\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n```bash\\n# Agents on disk: 16 files\\n# Agents in plugin.json: 15 declarations\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Add `\\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"` to the `agents` array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUE #2: Missing Command Declaration\\n\\n**File exists but NOT declared in plugin.json:**\\n- `commands/delegate.md` (exists on disk, not in commands array)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Command is not registered with Claude Code\\n- Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` or `/delegate`\\n- Recent feature addition (referenced in CLAUDE.md Task Routing section) is inaccessible\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n```bash\\n# Commands on disk: 13 files\\n# Commands in plugin.json: 12 declarations\\n```\\n\\n**Context from CLAUDE.md:**\\n> `/dev:delegate` command: On-demand delegation command (skills: dev:task-routing)\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to the `commands` array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ⚠️ ISSUE #3: Inaccurate Skills Count in Description\\n\\n**Current description claims:**\\n> \\\"45 skills.\\\"\\n\\n**Actual count:**\\n- **Declared in plugin.json:** 44 skill paths\\n- **SKILL.md files on disk:** 46 files\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\nThe description claims 45 skills, but the plugin.json declares 44. There are 46 actual SKILL.md files on disk, meaning 2 skills exist but aren't declared.\\n\\n**Discrepancy breakdown:**\\n- Plugin.json declares category paths (e.g., `./skills/frontend/react-typescript`)\\n- Disk has additional skills not declared (likely `task-routing` and one other)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Minor: Misleading documentation\\n- Users may expect different skill count\\n- Skill discovery may miss undeclared skills\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n1. Verify all skill directories with SKILL.md files are declared\\n2. Update description to match actual declared count\\n3. Consider adding missing skill declarations\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Against Conventions\\n\\n### ✅ Path Format\\n- All component paths use `./` prefix ✓\\n- Relative to plugin root ✓\\n- No absolute paths ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Naming Convention\\n- Plugin name is lowercase, no special characters ✓\\n- Component files use kebab-case ✓\\n- Agent/command/skill file extensions are `.md` ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Version Consistency\\n- Plugin version `1.29.0` matches marketplace.json ✓\\n- Semantic versioning format ✓\\n- Version mentioned in description ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Metadata Quality\\n- Description is informative and version-specific ✓\\n- Keywords are relevant and comprehensive ✓\\n- Author information complete ✓\\n- Category appropriate for plugin type ✓\\n\\n### ❌ Component Completeness\\n- Missing agent declaration (test-architect.md) ✗\\n- Missing command declaration (delegate.md) ✗\\n- Potential missing skill declarations ⚠️\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Cross-Reference with CLAUDE.md\\n\\nThe project's `CLAUDE.md` file references features that depend on complete declarations:\\n\\n1. **Task Routing Table** - References `dev:researcher`, `dev:developer`, etc.\\n   - ✅ All referenced agents ARE declared (except test-architect)\\n\\n2. **Subagent Selection** - References `/dev:delegate` command\\n   - ❌ Command exists but NOT declared in plugin.json\\n\\n3. **Skill Count** - Documentation claims \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n   - ⚠️ Actual declarations: 44, actual files: 46\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Well-structured JSON** - Clean formatting, valid syntax\\n2. **Comprehensive metadata** - Rich keywords, clear description\\n3. **Proper dependencies** - Multimodel plugin correctly declared\\n4. **MCP integration** - Valid claudish MCP server configuration\\n5. **Version consistency** - Matches marketplace.json exactly\\n6. **Convention adherence** - Follows plugin system standards\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Critical (Must Fix)\\n1. ✅ Add `\\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"` to agents array\\n2. ✅ Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n\\n### Important (Should Fix)\\n3. Audit all skill directories with SKILL.md files\\n4. Add missing skill declarations to plugin.json\\n5. Update description to reflect accurate skill count (44 or 46)\\n\\n### Nice-to-Have\\n6. Consider alphabetizing agent/command arrays for maintainability\\n7. Add comments (if JSON5 supported) explaining skill organization structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vote\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is sound but missing critical component declarations (test-architect agent, delegate command) that break discoverability and prevent feature usage.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing agent declaration (test-architect.md), Missing command declaration (delegate.md), Inaccurate skill count in description\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rationale for Rejection\\n\\nWhile the `plugin.json` structure follows conventions and most declarations are correct, **the missing agent and command declarations are blocking issues** that:\\n\\n1. **Break functionality** - Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` command\\n2. **Violate completeness** - Components exist but aren't registered\\n3. **Create confusion** - Documentation references unavailable features\\n4. **Fail discoverability** - Claude Code cannot find undeclared components\\n\\nThese are **not minor inconsistencies** - they represent incomplete plugin configuration that prevents legitimate features from being accessible. The issues are easily fixable (add 2 lines to arrays), but until fixed, the plugin.json does not accurately represent the plugin's capabilities.\\n\\n**Confidence level: 9/10** - Based on file system verification, cross-reference with marketplace.json, and clear evidence of missing declarations. Only reason not 10/10 is the complexity of skill directory structure which may have edge cases I haven't considered.\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":270,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":27293,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":270,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyhUQX6ZGaLcP1pxwM7Y\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.950Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"uuid\":\"34282af0-15ff-4d3f-b2e9-cdba20d775c7\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"34282af0-15ff-4d3f-b2e9-cdba20d775c7\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"uuid\":\"d27f4f6d-3d3c-4b99-b480-f4295eeffa0d\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-144244-6da028d0/internal-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"b9e3d4ad-a6c4-46fe-a72b-98c59fd6a90a\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b9e3d4ad-a6c4-46fe-a72b-98c59fd6a90a\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\"id\":\"msg_01DhLeEND2vis72tvJjEvDRo\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## Review Complete\\n\\nI've completed my independent review of `plugins/dev/plugin.json` and written the comprehensive analysis to the required file.\\n\\n**Key findings:**\\n\\n**VERDICT: REJECT**\\n\\n**Critical Issues Found:**\\n1. **Missing agent declaration**: `test-architect.md` exists on disk but is NOT declared in plugin.json (15 declared vs 16 files)\\n2. **Missing command declaration**: `delegate.md` exists on disk but is NOT declared in plugin.json (12 declared vs 13 files)\\n3. **Inaccurate skill count**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but plugin.json declares 44 (and 46 SKILL.md files exist on disk)\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- All required fields present and correct\\n- Version consistency with marketplace.json (1.29.0)\\n- Proper dependency declaration (multimodel@^2.0.0)\\n- Valid MCP configuration\\n- Follows Claude Code plugin conventions\\n- Comprehensive metadata and keywords\\n\\n**Impact:**\\nThe missing declarations break functionality - users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` command referenced in CLAUDE.md, and the test-architect agent is not discoverable.

PASS\\n\\nAll essential Claude Code plugin fields are present and correctly formatted:\\n\\n- **name**: `\\\"dev\\\"` - Valid plugin identifier\\n- **version**: `\\\"1.29.0\\\"` - Semantic versioning, matches marketplace.json\\n- **description**: Clear, version-specific, feature-focused\\n- **author**: Complete with name, email, company\\n- **license**: `\\\"MIT\\\"` - Standard open-source license\\n- **keywords**: Comprehensive (42 keywords covering all capabilities)\\n- **category**: `\\\"development\\\"` - Appropriate classification\\n- **compatibility**: `\\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"` - Version constraint present\\n\\n### ✅ Component Declarations - STRUCTURE VALID\\n\\nComponent arrays follow correct plugin system format:\\n\\n- **agents**: Array of 15 relative paths (`./agents/*.md`)\\n- **commands**: Array of 12 relative paths (`./commands/*.md`)\\n- **skills**: Array of 44 relative paths (`./skills/*`)\\n- **outputStyles**: Array of 1 relative path (`./output-styles/*.md`)\\n- **mcpServers**: String path to config file (`\\\"./.mcp.json\\\"`)\\n\\nAll paths use correct `./` prefix for plugin-relative references.\\n\\n### ✅ Dependencies - CORRECT\\n\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- Dependency on multimodel plugin correctly declared\\n- Version constraint uses caret (^) for compatible updates\\n- Format matches Claude Code plugin system requirements\\n\\n### ✅ MCP Configuration - VALID\\n\\nReferenced file `.mcp.json` exists and contains valid MCP server configuration:\\n- `claudish` MCP server properly configured\\n- Environment variable reference `${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}` correct\\n- Command and args structure valid\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Issues Identified\\n\\n### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUE #1: Missing Agent Declaration\\n\\n**File exists but NOT declared in plugin.json:**\\n- `agents/test-architect.md` (exists on disk, not in agents array)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Agent is not discoverable by Claude Code\\n- Task delegation to `dev:test-architect` will fail\\n- User documentation may reference unavailable agent\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n```bash\\n# Agents on disk: 16 files\\n# Agents in plugin.json: 15 declarations\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Add `\\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"` to the `agents` array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUE #2: Missing Command Declaration\\n\\n**File exists but NOT declared in plugin.json:**\\n- `commands/delegate.md` (exists on disk, not in commands array)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Command is not registered with Claude Code\\n- Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` or `/delegate`\\n- Recent feature addition (referenced in CLAUDE.md Task Routing section) is inaccessible\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n```bash\\n# Commands on disk: 13 files\\n# Commands in plugin.json: 12 declarations\\n```\\n\\n**Context from CLAUDE.md:**\\n> `/dev:delegate` command: On-demand delegation command (skills: dev:task-routing)\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to the `commands` array.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### ⚠️ ISSUE #3: Inaccurate Skills Count in Description\\n\\n**Current description claims:**\\n> \\\"45 skills.\\\"\\n\\n**Actual count:**\\n- **Declared in plugin.json:** 44 skill paths\\n- **SKILL.md files on disk:** 46 files\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\nThe description claims 45 skills, but the plugin.json declares 44. There are 46 actual SKILL.md files on disk, meaning 2 skills exist but aren't declared.\\n\\n**Discrepancy breakdown:**\\n- Plugin.json declares category paths (e.g., `./skills/frontend/react-typescript`)\\n- Disk has additional skills not declared (likely `task-routing` and one other)\\n\\n**Impact:**\\n- Minor: Misleading documentation\\n- Users may expect different skill count\\n- Skill discovery may miss undeclared skills\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n1. Verify all skill directories with SKILL.md files are declared\\n2. Update description to match actual declared count\\n3. Consider adding missing skill declarations\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Verification Against Conventions\\n\\n### ✅ Path Format\\n- All component paths use `./` prefix ✓\\n- Relative to plugin root ✓\\n- No absolute paths ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Naming Convention\\n- Plugin name is lowercase, no special characters ✓\\n- Component files use kebab-case ✓\\n- Agent/command/skill file extensions are `.md` ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Version Consistency\\n- Plugin version `1.29.0` matches marketplace.json ✓\\n- Semantic versioning format ✓\\n- Version mentioned in description ✓\\n\\n### ✅ Metadata Quality\\n- Description is informative and version-specific ✓\\n- Keywords are relevant and comprehensive ✓\\n- Author information complete ✓\\n- Category appropriate for plugin type ✓\\n\\n### ❌ Component Completeness\\n- Missing agent declaration (test-architect.md) ✗\\n- Missing command declaration (delegate.md) ✗\\n- Potential missing skill declarations ⚠️\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Cross-Reference with CLAUDE.md\\n\\nThe project's `CLAUDE.md` file references features that depend on complete declarations:\\n\\n1. **Task Routing Table** - References `dev:researcher`, `dev:developer`, etc.\\n   - ✅ All referenced agents ARE declared (except test-architect)\\n\\n2. **Subagent Selection** - References `/dev:delegate` command\\n   - ❌ Command exists but NOT declared in plugin.json\\n\\n3. **Skill Count** - Documentation claims \\\"45 skills\\\"\\n   - ⚠️ Actual declarations: 44, actual files: 46\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Strengths\\n\\n1. **Well-structured JSON** - Clean formatting, valid syntax\\n2. **Comprehensive metadata** - Rich keywords, clear description\\n3. **Proper dependencies** - Multimodel plugin correctly declared\\n4. **MCP integration** - Valid claudish MCP server configuration\\n5. **Version consistency** - Matches marketplace.json exactly\\n6. **Convention adherence** - Follows plugin system standards\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Critical (Must Fix)\\n1. ✅ Add `\\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"` to agents array\\n2. ✅ Add `\\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"` to commands array\\n\\n### Important (Should Fix)\\n3. Audit all skill directories with SKILL.md files\\n4. Add missing skill declarations to plugin.json\\n5. Update description to reflect accurate skill count (44 or 46)\\n\\n### Nice-to-Have\\n6. Consider alphabetizing agent/command arrays for maintainability\\n7. Add comments (if JSON5 supported) explaining skill organization structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Vote\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Plugin structure is sound but missing critical component declarations (test-architect agent, delegate command) that break discoverability and prevent feature usage.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing agent declaration (test-architect.md), Missing command declaration (delegate.md), Inaccurate skill count in description\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Rationale for Rejection\\n\\nWhile the `plugin.json` structure follows conventions and most declarations are correct, **the missing agent and command declarations are blocking issues** that:\\n\\n1. **Break functionality** - Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` command\\n2. **Violate completeness** - Components exist but aren't registered\\n3. **Create confusion** - Documentation references unavailable features\\n4. **Fail discoverability** - Claude Code cannot find undeclared components\\n\\nThese are **not minor inconsistencies** - they represent incomplete plugin configuration that prevents legitimate features from being accessible. The issues are easily fixable (add 2 lines to arrays), but until fixed, the plugin.json does not accurately represent the plugin's capabilities.\\n\\n**Confidence level: 9/10** - Based on file system verification, cross-reference with marketplace.json, and clear evidence of missing declarations. Only reason not 10/10 is the complexity of skill directory structure which may have edge cases I haven't considered.\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":270,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":27293,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":270,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyhUQX6ZGaLcP1pxwM7Y\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.950Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"uuid\":\"34282af0-15ff-4d3f-b2e9-cdba20d775c7\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"34282af0-15ff-4d3f-b2e9-cdba20d775c7\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"uuid\":\"d27f4f6d-3d3c-4b99-b480-f4295eeffa0d\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01AnGha6B2X2icQpCwN6BXRf\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-144244-6da028d0/internal-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"b9e3d4ad-a6c4-46fe-a72b-98c59fd6a90a\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:44:33.954Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"2ea8d611-7f84-4c3a-9e3f-2b8b83e06cfb\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"b9e3d4ad-a6c4-46fe-a72b-98c59fd6a90a\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"4bd8f6bb-8535-4c76-a4e5-2f8c70c77269\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a4b2969\",\"slug\":\"polymorphic-swimming-nygaard\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\"id\":\"msg_01DhLeEND2vis72tvJjEvDRo\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## Review Complete\\n\\nI've completed my independent review of `plugins/dev/plugin.json` and written the comprehensive analysis to the required file.\\n\\n**Key findings:**\\n\\n**VERDICT: REJECT**\\n\\n**Critical Issues Found:**\\n1. **Missing agent declaration**: `test-architect.md` exists on disk but is NOT declared in plugin.json (15 declared vs 16 files)\\n2. **Missing command declaration**: `delegate.md` exists on disk but is NOT declared in plugin.json (12 declared vs 13 files)\\n3. **Inaccurate skill count**: Description claims \\\"45 skills\\\" but plugin.json declares 44 (and 46 SKILL.md files exist on disk)\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n- All required fields present and correct\\n- Version consistency with marketplace.json (1.29.0)\\n- Proper dependency declaration (multimodel@^2.0.0)\\n- Valid MCP configuration\\n- Follows Claude Code plugin conventions\\n- Comprehensive metadata and keywords\\n\\n**Impact:**\\nThe missing declarations break functionality - users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` command referenced in CLAUDE.md, and the test-architect agent is not discoverable.
