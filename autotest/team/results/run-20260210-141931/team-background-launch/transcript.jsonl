The `run_in_background: true` parameter ensures both models start simultaneously rather than sequentially, cutting total wall-clock time roughly in half.\n\n**PROXY_MODE placement:** Notice how `PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1` goes on the very first line of the Grok prompt. The `dev:researcher` agent has a `<proxy_mode_support>` block that intercepts this directive and routes the task to the external model via claudish CLI. Without this, the prompt would just run on Claude Sonnet.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nI'll collect and parse the results once both agents finish.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"773c2d71-63e9-4ab6-bc10-e89023e17a46","total_cost_usd":0.38054075,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":15678,"cache_read_input_tokens":206940,"output_tokens":2089,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":15678},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":9,"outputTokens":2089,"cacheReadInputTokens":206940,"cacheCreationInputTokens":15678,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.2537275,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":842,"outputTokens":64,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0011619999999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":4,"outputTokens":1390,"cacheReadInputTokens":25050,"cacheCreationInputTokens":12537,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.12565125,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"ec372396-fdff-4012-9917-2471c58c8d6c"}
