Users cannot install these plugins via the marketplace.\\n\\n**Impact:** High - Users cannot discover or install these plugins.\\n\\n### Issue 2: CLAUDE.md Documentation Severely Outdated\\n**Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\nAll version references in CLAUDE.md are outdated:\\n- Plugin versions table (lines 16-26)\\n- Release notes section (lines 214-224)\\n- Git tags section (lines 234-244)\\n\\n**Impact:** High - Documentation misleads contributors about current versions, breaking the release checklist workflow.\\n\\n### Issue 3: Naming Inconsistency\\n**Severity:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe \\\"Orchestration\\\" entry in CLAUDE.md table (line 21) appears to refer to the \\\"multimodel\\\" plugin but uses a different name and has a severely outdated version (v0.8.2 vs actual v2.2.0).\\n\\n**Impact:** Medium - Confusion about plugin identity.\\n\\n### Issue 4: Conductor Plugin Missing from Table\\n**Severity:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe Conductor plugin is documented in release notes but completely missing from the plugin versions table in CLAUDE.md.\\n\\n**Impact:** Medium - Incomplete documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Plugin-by-Plugin Status Matrix\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | marketplace.json | CLAUDE.md Table | CLAUDE.md Notes | Status |\\n|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|\\n| code-analysis | 3.2.0 | 3.2.0 ✓ | 3.0.0 ❌ | 2.15.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| multimodel | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0 ✓ | 0.8.2 ❌ | 2.0.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| agentdev | 1.5.0 | 1.5.0 ✓ | 1.3.0 ❌ | 1.4.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| seo | 1.6.0 | 1.6.0 ✓ | 1.5.1 ❌ | 1.5.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| video-editing | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 ✓ | 1.0.1 ❌ | 1.0.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| nanobanana | 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 ✓ | 2.2.3 ❌ | 2.2.3 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| conductor | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 ✓ | MISSING ❌ | 2.0.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| dev | 1.29.0 | 1.29.0 ✓ | 1.26.0 ❌ | 1.29.0 ✓ | PARTIAL |\\n| frontend | 3.14.0 | MISSING ❌ | 3.13.0 ❌ | 3.13.0 ❌ | CRITICAL |\\n| bun | 1.6.0 | MISSING ❌ | 1.5.2 ❌ | 1.5.2 ❌ | CRITICAL |\\n\\n**Legend:**\\n- ✓ = Correct version\\n- ❌ = Incorrect or missing\\n- MISMATCH = Inconsistent across sources\\n- PARTIAL = Some sources correct, others incorrect\\n- CRITICAL = Missing from marketplace entirely\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json:**\\n   - Add frontend plugin entry with version 3.14.0\\n   - Add bun plugin entry with version 1.6.0\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md documentation:**\\n   - Update plugin versions table (lines 16-26) to match current plugin.json versions\\n   - Update release notes section (lines 214-224) to match current versions\\n   - Update git tags section (lines 234-244) to match current versions\\n   - Add Conductor plugin to the table\\n   - Rename \\\"Orchestration\\\" to \\\"Multimodel\\\" in the table for consistency\\n\\n3. **Verify git tags exist:**\\n   - Check if git tags match the versions in plugin.json files\\n   - Create missing tags if needed\\n\\n### Process Improvement\\n\\nAccording to CLAUDE.md's own release checklist (lines 247-253), all three sources must be updated during release:\\n1. Plugin version in plugin.json\\n2. Marketplace version in marketplace.json\\n3. Git tag\\n\\n**Current situation shows this process is not being followed consistently.**\\n\\nRecommendation: Create an automated validation script that runs in CI/CD to catch version mismatches before merge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Summary\\n\\n**Total Plugins Analyzed:** 10\\n**Plugins with Issues:** 10 (100%)\\n**Critical Issues:** 2 (missing marketplace entries)\\n**High Severity Issues:** 3 (significant version drift)\\n**Medium Severity Issues:** 5 (minor version drift)\\n\\n**Primary Source of Truth:** plugin.json files (actual code)\\n**Secondary Source (Correct):** marketplace.json (missing 2 entries)\\n**Tertiary Source (Outdated):** CLAUDE.md documentation (all entries outdated)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: All 10 plugins have version inconsistencies, with 2 plugins completely missing from marketplace and all CLAUDE.md references outdated.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing marketplace entries (frontend, bun), Outdated CLAUDE.md documentation across all plugins, Naming inconsistency (Orchestration vs Multimodel), Conductor plugin missing from table\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8737,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":26564,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8737,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":2,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXygkeQM6QcFTGk67buTL\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.295Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.299Z\",\"uuid\":\"576c8887-1c8d-4a34-9e4e-9d5b8d5db28e\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"576c8887-1c8d-4a34-9e4e-9d5b8d5db28e\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.299Z\",\"uuid\":\"2bad4ac6-e226-40ca-97e6-6af8b074ab71\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-143350-e91c4e17/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"66e5c14c-f504-45bb-b808-5205b1577709\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.298Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"66e5c14c-f504-45bb-b808-5205b1577709\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\"id\":\"msg_017YeWmjWE8BQKaZguGS1LAh\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## Analysis Complete\\n\\nI've completed my independent review of plugin version numbers across the repository.

Users cannot install these plugins via the marketplace.\\n\\n**Impact:** High - Users cannot discover or install these plugins.\\n\\n### Issue 2: CLAUDE.md Documentation Severely Outdated\\n**Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\nAll version references in CLAUDE.md are outdated:\\n- Plugin versions table (lines 16-26)\\n- Release notes section (lines 214-224)\\n- Git tags section (lines 234-244)\\n\\n**Impact:** High - Documentation misleads contributors about current versions, breaking the release checklist workflow.\\n\\n### Issue 3: Naming Inconsistency\\n**Severity:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe \\\"Orchestration\\\" entry in CLAUDE.md table (line 21) appears to refer to the \\\"multimodel\\\" plugin but uses a different name and has a severely outdated version (v0.8.2 vs actual v2.2.0).\\n\\n**Impact:** Medium - Confusion about plugin identity.\\n\\n### Issue 4: Conductor Plugin Missing from Table\\n**Severity:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe Conductor plugin is documented in release notes but completely missing from the plugin versions table in CLAUDE.md.\\n\\n**Impact:** Medium - Incomplete documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Plugin-by-Plugin Status Matrix\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | marketplace.json | CLAUDE.md Table | CLAUDE.md Notes | Status |\\n|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|\\n| code-analysis | 3.2.0 | 3.2.0 ✓ | 3.0.0 ❌ | 2.15.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| multimodel | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0 ✓ | 0.8.2 ❌ | 2.0.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| agentdev | 1.5.0 | 1.5.0 ✓ | 1.3.0 ❌ | 1.4.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| seo | 1.6.0 | 1.6.0 ✓ | 1.5.1 ❌ | 1.5.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| video-editing | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 ✓ | 1.0.1 ❌ | 1.0.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| nanobanana | 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 ✓ | 2.2.3 ❌ | 2.2.3 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| conductor | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 ✓ | MISSING ❌ | 2.0.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| dev | 1.29.0 | 1.29.0 ✓ | 1.26.0 ❌ | 1.29.0 ✓ | PARTIAL |\\n| frontend | 3.14.0 | MISSING ❌ | 3.13.0 ❌ | 3.13.0 ❌ | CRITICAL |\\n| bun | 1.6.0 | MISSING ❌ | 1.5.2 ❌ | 1.5.2 ❌ | CRITICAL |\\n\\n**Legend:**\\n- ✓ = Correct version\\n- ❌ = Incorrect or missing\\n- MISMATCH = Inconsistent across sources\\n- PARTIAL = Some sources correct, others incorrect\\n- CRITICAL = Missing from marketplace entirely\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json:**\\n   - Add frontend plugin entry with version 3.14.0\\n   - Add bun plugin entry with version 1.6.0\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md documentation:**\\n   - Update plugin versions table (lines 16-26) to match current plugin.json versions\\n   - Update release notes section (lines 214-224) to match current versions\\n   - Update git tags section (lines 234-244) to match current versions\\n   - Add Conductor plugin to the table\\n   - Rename \\\"Orchestration\\\" to \\\"Multimodel\\\" in the table for consistency\\n\\n3. **Verify git tags exist:**\\n   - Check if git tags match the versions in plugin.json files\\n   - Create missing tags if needed\\n\\n### Process Improvement\\n\\nAccording to CLAUDE.md's own release checklist (lines 247-253), all three sources must be updated during release:\\n1. Plugin version in plugin.json\\n2. Marketplace version in marketplace.json\\n3. Git tag\\n\\n**Current situation shows this process is not being followed consistently.**\\n\\nRecommendation: Create an automated validation script that runs in CI/CD to catch version mismatches before merge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Summary\\n\\n**Total Plugins Analyzed:** 10\\n**Plugins with Issues:** 10 (100%)\\n**Critical Issues:** 2 (missing marketplace entries)\\n**High Severity Issues:** 3 (significant version drift)\\n**Medium Severity Issues:** 5 (minor version drift)\\n\\n**Primary Source of Truth:** plugin.json files (actual code)\\n**Secondary Source (Correct):** marketplace.json (missing 2 entries)\\n**Tertiary Source (Outdated):** CLAUDE.md documentation (all entries outdated)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: All 10 plugins have version inconsistencies, with 2 plugins completely missing from marketplace and all CLAUDE.md references outdated.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing marketplace entries (frontend, bun), Outdated CLAUDE.md documentation across all plugins, Naming inconsistency (Orchestration vs Multimodel), Conductor plugin missing from table\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8737,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":26564,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8737,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":2,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXygkeQM6QcFTGk67buTL\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.295Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.299Z\",\"uuid\":\"576c8887-1c8d-4a34-9e4e-9d5b8d5db28e\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"576c8887-1c8d-4a34-9e4e-9d5b8d5db28e\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.299Z\",\"uuid\":\"2bad4ac6-e226-40ca-97e6-6af8b074ab71\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-143350-e91c4e17/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"66e5c14c-f504-45bb-b808-5205b1577709\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.298Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"66e5c14c-f504-45bb-b808-5205b1577709\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\"id\":\"msg_017YeWmjWE8BQKaZguGS1LAh\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## Analysis Complete\\n\\nI've completed my independent review of plugin version numbers across the repository.

Users cannot install these plugins via the marketplace.\\n\\n**Impact:** High - Users cannot discover or install these plugins.\\n\\n### Issue 2: CLAUDE.md Documentation Severely Outdated\\n**Severity:** CRITICAL\\n\\nAll version references in CLAUDE.md are outdated:\\n- Plugin versions table (lines 16-26)\\n- Release notes section (lines 214-224)\\n- Git tags section (lines 234-244)\\n\\n**Impact:** High - Documentation misleads contributors about current versions, breaking the release checklist workflow.\\n\\n### Issue 3: Naming Inconsistency\\n**Severity:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe \\\"Orchestration\\\" entry in CLAUDE.md table (line 21) appears to refer to the \\\"multimodel\\\" plugin but uses a different name and has a severely outdated version (v0.8.2 vs actual v2.2.0).\\n\\n**Impact:** Medium - Confusion about plugin identity.\\n\\n### Issue 4: Conductor Plugin Missing from Table\\n**Severity:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe Conductor plugin is documented in release notes but completely missing from the plugin versions table in CLAUDE.md.\\n\\n**Impact:** Medium - Incomplete documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Plugin-by-Plugin Status Matrix\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | marketplace.json | CLAUDE.md Table | CLAUDE.md Notes | Status |\\n|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|\\n| code-analysis | 3.2.0 | 3.2.0 ✓ | 3.0.0 ❌ | 2.15.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| multimodel | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0 ✓ | 0.8.2 ❌ | 2.0.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| agentdev | 1.5.0 | 1.5.0 ✓ | 1.3.0 ❌ | 1.4.0 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| seo | 1.6.0 | 1.6.0 ✓ | 1.5.1 ❌ | 1.5.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| video-editing | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 ✓ | 1.0.1 ❌ | 1.0.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| nanobanana | 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 ✓ | 2.2.3 ❌ | 2.2.3 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| conductor | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 ✓ | MISSING ❌ | 2.0.1 ❌ | MISMATCH |\\n| dev | 1.29.0 | 1.29.0 ✓ | 1.26.0 ❌ | 1.29.0 ✓ | PARTIAL |\\n| frontend | 3.14.0 | MISSING ❌ | 3.13.0 ❌ | 3.13.0 ❌ | CRITICAL |\\n| bun | 1.6.0 | MISSING ❌ | 1.5.2 ❌ | 1.5.2 ❌ | CRITICAL |\\n\\n**Legend:**\\n- ✓ = Correct version\\n- ❌ = Incorrect or missing\\n- MISMATCH = Inconsistent across sources\\n- PARTIAL = Some sources correct, others incorrect\\n- CRITICAL = Missing from marketplace entirely\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json:**\\n   - Add frontend plugin entry with version 3.14.0\\n   - Add bun plugin entry with version 1.6.0\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md documentation:**\\n   - Update plugin versions table (lines 16-26) to match current plugin.json versions\\n   - Update release notes section (lines 214-224) to match current versions\\n   - Update git tags section (lines 234-244) to match current versions\\n   - Add Conductor plugin to the table\\n   - Rename \\\"Orchestration\\\" to \\\"Multimodel\\\" in the table for consistency\\n\\n3. **Verify git tags exist:**\\n   - Check if git tags match the versions in plugin.json files\\n   - Create missing tags if needed\\n\\n### Process Improvement\\n\\nAccording to CLAUDE.md's own release checklist (lines 247-253), all three sources must be updated during release:\\n1. Plugin version in plugin.json\\n2. Marketplace version in marketplace.json\\n3. Git tag\\n\\n**Current situation shows this process is not being followed consistently.**\\n\\nRecommendation: Create an automated validation script that runs in CI/CD to catch version mismatches before merge.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Summary\\n\\n**Total Plugins Analyzed:** 10\\n**Plugins with Issues:** 10 (100%)\\n**Critical Issues:** 2 (missing marketplace entries)\\n**High Severity Issues:** 3 (significant version drift)\\n**Medium Severity Issues:** 5 (minor version drift)\\n\\n**Primary Source of Truth:** plugin.json files (actual code)\\n**Secondary Source (Correct):** marketplace.json (missing 2 entries)\\n**Tertiary Source (Outdated):** CLAUDE.md documentation (all entries outdated)\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: All 10 plugins have version inconsistencies, with 2 plugins completely missing from marketplace and all CLAUDE.md references outdated.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing marketplace entries (frontend, bun), Outdated CLAUDE.md documentation across all plugins, Naming inconsistency (Orchestration vs Multimodel), Conductor plugin missing from table\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":8737,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":26564,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":8737,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":2,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXygkeQM6QcFTGk67buTL\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.295Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.299Z\",\"uuid\":\"576c8887-1c8d-4a34-9e4e-9d5b8d5db28e\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"576c8887-1c8d-4a34-9e4e-9d5b8d5db28e\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.299Z\",\"uuid\":\"2bad4ac6-e226-40ca-97e6-6af8b074ab71\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_014TuJKGVd5zqeHSJXn2kCrJ\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-143350-e91c4e17/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"66e5c14c-f504-45bb-b808-5205b1577709\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:35:05.298Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"c9bb6e68-8fdf-471b-a083-d0a8c4a70bda\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"66e5c14c-f504-45bb-b808-5205b1577709\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"3393630f-2ab8-40db-aaf1-fabaad142f34\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"a9980b4\",\"slug\":\"quiet-crunching-neumann\",\"message\":{\"model\":\"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\"id\":\"msg_017YeWmjWE8BQKaZguGS1LAh\",\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## Analysis Complete\\n\\nI've completed my independent review of plugin version numbers across the repository.
