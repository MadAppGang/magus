The manifest follows Claude Code plugin system requirements and maintains consistency with the marketplace listing. However, I identified **4 critical discrepancies** between declared components and actual filesystem state, plus **1 version inconsistency** in documentation.\n\n**Overall Assessment**: **Strong structure with minor integrity issues requiring attention.**\n\n---\n\n## Analysis by Category\n\n### 1. Core Metadata (PASS)\n\n**Fields Analyzed**:\n- `name`: \"dev\" ✓ (valid, matches namespace)\n- `version`: \"1.29.0\" ✓ (semantic versioning, matches git tag format)\n- `description`: Comprehensive, includes version and skill count ✓\n- `author`: Complete with name, email, company ✓\n- `license`: \"MIT\" ✓ (matches repository LICENSE file)\n- `keywords`: 41 keywords covering technology stacks ✓\n- `category`: \"development\" ✓\n\n**Evidence**: All required fields present with correct types.\n\n**Quality Score**: 10/10\n\n---\n\n### 2. Agent Declarations (CRITICAL ISSUE)\n\n**Declared**: 15 agents\n**Actual**: 16 agents on filesystem\n\n**Discrepancy Identified**:\n```\nDECLARED in plugin.json (15):\n- stack-detector, skill-discovery, developer, debugger, architect\n- ui, ui-engineer, scribe, spec-writer, devops\n- researcher, synthesizer, doc-writer, doc-analyzer, doc-fixer\n\nACTUAL on filesystem (16):\n- All 15 above PLUS:\n- test-architect.md ← NOT DECLARED\n```\n\n**Impact**: The `test-architect` agent exists in `/plugins/dev/agents/test-architect.md` but is **not registered** in `plugin.json`. This means:\n1. Claude Code plugin system won't load it\n2. Users cannot access it via Task tool\n3.

According to CLAUDE.md memory context:\n\n> \"Created /dev:delegate command... loaded by skills: dev:task-routing\"\n\nThis is a **documented feature** (Section 16 of research-subagent-selection.md) but missing from manifest. Users cannot invoke `/dev:delegate` until it's added to `plugin.json`.\n\n**Quality Score**: 7/10 (critical command missing)\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Documentation Quality)\n\nUpdate README.md version references:\n- Line 3: Change \"1.1.0\" → \"1.29.0\"\n- Line 384: Change \"1.1.0\" → \"1.29.0\"\n- Add changelog section referencing version history\n\n### Priority 4 (LOW -

The manifest follows Claude Code plugin system requirements and maintains consistency with the marketplace listing. However, I identified **4 critical discrepancies** between declared components and actual filesystem state, plus **1 version inconsistency** in documentation.\n\n**Overall Assessment**: **Strong structure with minor integrity issues requiring attention.**\n\n---\n\n## Analysis by Category\n\n### 1. Core Metadata (PASS)\n\n**Fields Analyzed**:\n- `name`: \"dev\" ✓ (valid, matches namespace)\n- `version`: \"1.29.0\" ✓ (semantic versioning, matches git tag format)\n- `description`: Comprehensive, includes version and skill count ✓\n- `author`: Complete with name, email, company ✓\n- `license`: \"MIT\" ✓ (matches repository LICENSE file)\n- `keywords`: 41 keywords covering technology stacks ✓\n- `category`: \"development\" ✓\n\n**Evidence**: All required fields present with correct types.\n\n**Quality Score**: 10/10\n\n---\n\n### 2.

This means:\n1. Claude Code plugin system won't load it\n2. Users cannot access it via Task tool\n3.

When you add a file to `agents/` or `skills/`, you must *also* register it in `plugin.json` — the plugin loader only sees declared components, not raw files on disk. This is by design: it gives maintainers explicit control over what's exposed.\n- **Coverage metric** (94.8% — 73/77 components registered) is a useful health check. A CI script that diffs `ls plugins/dev/agents/*.md` against `jq '.agents[]' plugin.json` would catch these regressions automatically.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4295,"cache_read_input_tokens":44980,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4295,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"97f4a4a7-3488-401e-8530-b3e27919135d","uuid":"c041be71-8b53-4e14-b41a-8106c8c6551a"}
