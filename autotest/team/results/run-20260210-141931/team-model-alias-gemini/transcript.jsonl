Multiple plugins have inconsistent version numbers between their actual plugin.json files, the marketplace.json manifest, and the CLAUDE.md documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Version Comparison Table\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | marketplace.json | CLAUDE.md | Status |\\n|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------|\\n| **code-analysis** | 3.2.0 | 3.2.0 | **v2.15.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **multimodel** | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0 | **v2.0.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **agentdev** | 1.5.0 | 1.5.0 | **v1.4.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **seo** | 1.6.0 | 1.6.0 | **v1.5.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **video-editing** | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | **v1.0.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **nanobanana** | 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 | **v2.2.3** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **conductor** | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 | **v2.0.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **dev** | 1.29.0 | 1.29.0 | **v1.26.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **frontend** | **3.14.0** | **NOT FOUND** | v3.13.0 | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **bun** | **1.6.0** | **NOT FOUND** | v1.5.2 | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues Identified\\n\\n### Issue 1: CLAUDE.md Documentation is Severely Outdated\\n**Impact:** HIGH\\n\\nThe CLAUDE.md file (lines 214-224) contains version numbers that are significantly behind the actual plugin versions:\\n\\n- **code-analysis**: Documented as v2.15.0, actual is 3.2.0 (major version behind)\\n- **multimodel**: Documented as v2.0.0, actual is 2.2.0\\n- **agentdev**: Documented as v1.4.0, actual is 1.5.0\\n- **seo**: Documented as v1.5.1, actual is 1.6.0\\n- **video-editing**: Documented as v1.0.1, actual is 1.1.0\\n- **nanobanana**: Documented as v2.2.3, actual is 2.3.0\\n- **conductor**: Documented as v2.0.1, actual is 2.1.0\\n- **dev**: Documented as v1.26.0, actual is 1.29.0\\n- **frontend**: Documented as v3.13.0, actual is 3.14.0\\n- **bun**: Documented as v1.5.2, actual is 1.6.0\\n\\n### Issue 2: Missing Plugins in marketplace.json\\n**Impact:** CRITICAL\\n\\nTwo plugins are completely missing from the marketplace.json file:\\n\\n1. **frontend** - Has plugin.json (v3.14.0) but no marketplace entry\\n2. **bun** - Has plugin.json (v1.6.0) but no marketplace entry\\n\\nThis means these plugins cannot be discovered or installed via the Claude Code plugin marketplace.\\n\\n### Issue 3: Table Inconsistency in CLAUDE.md\\n**Impact:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe CLAUDE.md file contains a plugin table (lines 16-26) that shows:\\n- **Code Analysis** as v3.0.0 (should be 3.2.0)\\n- **Dev** as v1.26.0 (should be 1.29.0)\\n\\nPlus it references \\\"Orchestration v0.8.2\\\" which doesn't exist as a separate plugin (this appears to be legacy naming for the multimodel plugin).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Findings\\n\\n### Source 1: plugin.json Files (Actual Versions)\\nLocated in `plugins/*/plugin.json`, these are the source of truth for actual plugin versions:\\n\\n```\\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0\\nmultimodel:      2.2.0\\nagentdev:        1.5.0\\nseo:             1.6.0\\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0\\nnanobanana:      2.3.0\\nconductor:       2.1.0\\ndev:             1.29.0\\nfrontend:        3.14.0\\nbun:             1.6.0\\n```\\n\\n### Source 2: marketplace.json (Marketplace Registry)\\nLocated in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:\\n\\n```\\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0  ✓\\nmultimodel:      2.2.0  ✓\\nagentdev:        1.5.0  ✓\\nseo:             1.6.0  ✓\\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0  ✓\\nnanobanana:      2.3.0  ✓\\nconductor:       2.1.0  ✓\\ndev:             1.29.0  ✓\\nfrontend:        [MISSING]  ❌\\nbun:             [MISSING]  ❌\\n```\\n\\n### Source 3: CLAUDE.md (Documentation)\\nLocated in `CLAUDE.md` lines 214-224:\\n\\n```\\nMultimodel:           v2.0.0   ❌ (actual: 2.2.0)\\nFrontend:             v3.13.0  ❌ (actual: 3.14.0)\\nCode Analysis:        v2.15.0  ❌ (actual: 3.2.0)\\nBun Backend:          v1.5.2   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\\nAgent Development:    v1.4.0   ❌ (actual: 1.5.0)\\nSEO:                  v1.5.1   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\\nVideo Editing:        v1.0.1   ❌ (actual: 1.1.0)\\nNanobanana:           v2.2.3   ❌ (actual: 2.3.0)\\nConductor:            v2.0.1   ❌ (actual: 2.1.0)\\nDev:                  v1.29.0  ✓ (matches!)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Analysis\\n\\n### For Users\\n- **CLAUDE.md serves as the primary reference** - users will see incorrect version numbers\\n- **Missing marketplace entries** mean frontend and bun plugins cannot be installed via standard methods\\n- **Git tag references** in CLAUDE.md (lines 234-244) are also likely outdated\\n\\n### For Maintainers\\n- Violates the documented release checklist (CLAUDE.md lines 247-251) which states ALL THREE must be updated\\n- Creates confusion about which version is current\\n- Risks users checking out wrong git tags\\n\\n### For Claudeup Tool\\n- Missing marketplace entries break plugin discovery\\n- Version mismatches may cause cache invalidation issues\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n\\n### Immediate (Critical)\\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries** for frontend and bun plugins\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md version table** (lines 214-224) to match actual versions\\n3. **Update CLAUDE.md plugin table** (lines 16-26) to match actual versions\\n\\n### Follow-up\\n1. Verify git tags match actual plugin versions\\n2. Update \\\"Last Updated\\\" date in CLAUDE.md (currently Feb 3, 2026)\\n3. Consider adding automated version consistency checks to CI/CD\\n\\n### Process Improvement\\n1. The release checklist exists but appears not to be followed\\n2. Consider adding a pre-commit hook or CI check to enforce version consistency\\n3. Document the version update order (plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md → git tag)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Files\\n\\nAll evidence gathered from:\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/*/plugin.json` (10 plugins checked)\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: Critical version mismatches found -

Has plugin.json (v3.14.0) but no marketplace entry\\n2. **bun** - Has plugin.json (v1.6.0) but no marketplace entry\\n\\nThis means these plugins cannot be discovered or installed via the Claude Code plugin marketplace.\\n\\n### Issue 3: Table Inconsistency in CLAUDE.md\\n**Impact:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe CLAUDE.md file contains a plugin table (lines 16-26) that shows:\\n- **Code Analysis** as v3.0.0 (should be 3.2.0)\\n- **Dev** as v1.26.0 (should be 1.29.0)\\n\\nPlus it references \\\"Orchestration v0.8.2\\\" which doesn't exist as a separate plugin (this appears to be legacy naming for the multimodel plugin).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Findings\\n\\n### Source 1: plugin.json Files (Actual Versions)\\nLocated in `plugins/*/plugin.json`, these are the source of truth for actual plugin versions:\\n\\n```\\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0\\nmultimodel:      2.2.0\\nagentdev:        1.5.0\\nseo:             1.6.0\\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0\\nnanobanana:      2.3.0\\nconductor:       2.1.0\\ndev:             1.29.0\\nfrontend:        3.14.0\\nbun:             1.6.0\\n```\\n\\n### Source 2: marketplace.json (Marketplace Registry)\\nLocated in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:\\n\\n```\\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0  ✓\\nmultimodel:      2.2.0  ✓\\nagentdev:        1.5.0  ✓\\nseo:             1.6.0  ✓\\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0  ✓\\nnanobanana:      2.3.0  ✓\\nconductor:       2.1.0  ✓\\ndev:             1.29.0  ✓\\nfrontend:        [MISSING]  ❌\\nbun:             [MISSING]  ❌\\n```\\n\\n### Source 3: CLAUDE.md (Documentation)\\nLocated in `CLAUDE.md` lines 214-224:\\n\\n```\\nMultimodel:           v2.0.0   ❌ (actual: 2.2.0)\\nFrontend:             v3.13.0  ❌ (actual: 3.14.0)\\nCode Analysis:        v2.15.0  ❌ (actual: 3.2.0)\\nBun Backend:          v1.5.2   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\\nAgent Development:    v1.4.0   ❌ (actual: 1.5.0)\\nSEO:                  v1.5.1   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\\nVideo Editing:        v1.0.1   ❌ (actual: 1.1.0)\\nNanobanana:           v2.2.3   ❌ (actual: 2.3.0)\\nConductor:            v2.0.1   ❌ (actual: 2.1.0)\\nDev:                  v1.29.0  ✓ (matches!)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Analysis\\n\\n### For Users\\n- **CLAUDE.md serves as the primary reference** - users will see incorrect version numbers\\n- **Missing marketplace entries** mean frontend and bun plugins cannot be installed via standard methods\\n- **Git tag references** in CLAUDE.md (lines 234-244) are also likely outdated\\n\\n### For Maintainers\\n- Violates the documented release checklist (CLAUDE.md lines 247-251) which states ALL THREE must be updated\\n- Creates confusion about which version is current\\n- Risks users checking out wrong git tags\\n\\n### For Claudeup Tool\\n- Missing marketplace entries break plugin discovery\\n- Version mismatches may cause cache invalidation issues\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n\\n### Immediate (Critical)\\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries** for frontend and bun plugins\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md version table** (lines 214-224) to match actual versions\\n3. **Update CLAUDE.md plugin table** (lines 16-26) to match actual versions\\n\\n### Follow-up\\n1. Verify git tags match actual plugin versions\\n2. Update \\\"Last Updated\\\" date in CLAUDE.md (currently Feb 3, 2026)\\n3. Consider adding automated version consistency checks to CI/CD\\n\\n### Process Improvement\\n1. The release checklist exists but appears not to be followed\\n2. Consider adding a pre-commit hook or CI check to enforce version consistency\\n3. Document the version update order (plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md → git tag)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Files\\n\\nAll evidence gathered from:\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/*/plugin.json` (10 plugins checked)\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: Critical version mismatches found -

Multiple plugins have inconsistent version numbers between their actual plugin.json files, the marketplace.json manifest, and the CLAUDE.md documentation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Version Comparison Table\\n\\n| Plugin | plugin.json | marketplace.json | CLAUDE.md | Status |\\n|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------|\\n| **code-analysis** | 3.2.0 | 3.2.0 | **v2.15.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **multimodel** | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0 | **v2.0.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **agentdev** | 1.5.0 | 1.5.0 | **v1.4.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **seo** | 1.6.0 | 1.6.0 | **v1.5.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **video-editing** | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | **v1.0.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **nanobanana** | 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 | **v2.2.3** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **conductor** | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 | **v2.0.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **dev** | 1.29.0 | 1.29.0 | **v1.26.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **frontend** | **3.14.0** | **NOT FOUND** | v3.13.0 | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n| **bun** | **1.6.0** | **NOT FOUND** | v1.5.2 | ❌ MISMATCH |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues Identified\\n\\n### Issue 1: CLAUDE.md Documentation is Severely Outdated\\n**Impact:** HIGH\\n\\nThe CLAUDE.md file (lines 214-224) contains version numbers that are significantly behind the actual plugin versions:\\n\\n- **code-analysis**: Documented as v2.15.0, actual is 3.2.0 (major version behind)\\n- **multimodel**: Documented as v2.0.0, actual is 2.2.0\\n- **agentdev**: Documented as v1.4.0, actual is 1.5.0\\n- **seo**: Documented as v1.5.1, actual is 1.6.0\\n- **video-editing**: Documented as v1.0.1, actual is 1.1.0\\n- **nanobanana**: Documented as v2.2.3, actual is 2.3.0\\n- **conductor**: Documented as v2.0.1, actual is 2.1.0\\n- **dev**: Documented as v1.26.0, actual is 1.29.0\\n- **frontend**: Documented as v3.13.0, actual is 3.14.0\\n- **bun**: Documented as v1.5.2, actual is 1.6.0\\n\\n### Issue 2: Missing Plugins in marketplace.json\\n**Impact:** CRITICAL\\n\\nTwo plugins are completely missing from the marketplace.json file:\\n\\n1. **frontend** - Has plugin.json (v3.14.0) but no marketplace entry\\n2. **bun** - Has plugin.json (v1.6.0) but no marketplace entry\\n\\nThis means these plugins cannot be discovered or installed via the Claude Code plugin marketplace.\\n\\n### Issue 3: Table Inconsistency in CLAUDE.md\\n**Impact:** MEDIUM\\n\\nThe CLAUDE.md file contains a plugin table (lines 16-26) that shows:\\n- **Code Analysis** as v3.0.0 (should be 3.2.0)\\n- **Dev** as v1.26.0 (should be 1.29.0)\\n\\nPlus it references \\\"Orchestration v0.8.2\\\" which doesn't exist as a separate plugin (this appears to be legacy naming for the multimodel plugin).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Findings\\n\\n### Source 1: plugin.json Files (Actual Versions)\\nLocated in `plugins/*/plugin.json`, these are the source of truth for actual plugin versions:\\n\\n```\\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0\\nmultimodel:      2.2.0\\nagentdev:        1.5.0\\nseo:             1.6.0\\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0\\nnanobanana:      2.3.0\\nconductor:       2.1.0\\ndev:             1.29.0\\nfrontend:        3.14.0\\nbun:             1.6.0\\n```\\n\\n### Source 2: marketplace.json (Marketplace Registry)\\nLocated in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:\\n\\n```\\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0  ✓\\nmultimodel:      2.2.0  ✓\\nagentdev:        1.5.0  ✓\\nseo:             1.6.0  ✓\\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0  ✓\\nnanobanana:      2.3.0  ✓\\nconductor:       2.1.0  ✓\\ndev:             1.29.0  ✓\\nfrontend:        [MISSING]  ❌\\nbun:             [MISSING]  ❌\\n```\\n\\n### Source 3: CLAUDE.md (Documentation)\\nLocated in `CLAUDE.md` lines 214-224:\\n\\n```\\nMultimodel:           v2.0.0   ❌ (actual: 2.2.0)\\nFrontend:             v3.13.0  ❌ (actual: 3.14.0)\\nCode Analysis:        v2.15.0  ❌ (actual: 3.2.0)\\nBun Backend:          v1.5.2   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\\nAgent Development:    v1.4.0   ❌ (actual: 1.5.0)\\nSEO:                  v1.5.1   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\\nVideo Editing:        v1.0.1   ❌ (actual: 1.1.0)\\nNanobanana:           v2.2.3   ❌ (actual: 2.3.0)\\nConductor:            v2.0.1   ❌ (actual: 2.1.0)\\nDev:                  v1.29.0  ✓ (matches!)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact Analysis\\n\\n### For Users\\n- **CLAUDE.md serves as the primary reference** - users will see incorrect version numbers\\n- **Missing marketplace entries** mean frontend and bun plugins cannot be installed via standard methods\\n- **Git tag references** in CLAUDE.md (lines 234-244) are also likely outdated\\n\\n### For Maintainers\\n- Violates the documented release checklist (CLAUDE.md lines 247-251) which states ALL THREE must be updated\\n- Creates confusion about which version is current\\n- Risks users checking out wrong git tags\\n\\n### For Claudeup Tool\\n- Missing marketplace entries break plugin discovery\\n- Version mismatches may cause cache invalidation issues\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommended Actions\\n\\n### Immediate (Critical)\\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries** for frontend and bun plugins\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md version table** (lines 214-224) to match actual versions\\n3. **Update CLAUDE.md plugin table** (lines 16-26) to match actual versions\\n\\n### Follow-up\\n1. Verify git tags match actual plugin versions\\n2. Update \\\"Last Updated\\\" date in CLAUDE.md (currently Feb 3, 2026)\\n3. Consider adding automated version consistency checks to CI/CD\\n\\n### Process Improvement\\n1. The release checklist exists but appears not to be followed\\n2. Consider adding a pre-commit hook or CI check to enforce version consistency\\n3. Document the version update order (plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md → git tag)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Files\\n\\nAll evidence gathered from:\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/*/plugin.json` (10 plugins checked)\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: Critical version mismatches found -

Code Analysis: v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\\n   - Agent Development: v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\\n   - SEO: v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\\n   - Video Editing: v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\\n   - Nanobanana: v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\\n   - Conductor: v2.0.1 → v2.1.0\\n   - Frontend: v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\\n   - Bun: v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\\n   - Dev: v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\\n   - Multimodel: v2.0.0 → v2.2.0\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224)** to match\\n\\n3. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json**:\\n   - frontend (version 3.14.0)\\n   - bun (version 1.6.0)\\n\\n4. **Investigate autopilot and instantly plugins**:\\n   - These have plugin.json files but aren't documented anywhere\\n   - Decision needed: include in marketplace or remove from repo\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Automated Version Validation**:\\n   - Add pre-commit hook to verify version consistency\\n   - Script to compare plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md\\n\\n2. **Release Checklist Enhancement**:\\n   - The existing checklist (lines 247-252) mentions all 3 locations\\n   - But clearly not being followed consistently\\n   - Consider adding automated check that blocks release without all 3 updates\\n\\n3. **Single Source of Truth**:\\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from marketplace.json\\n   - Reduces manual sync burden\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Source Quality Assessment\\n\\n### High Quality Sources\\n- **plugin.json files**: Primary source of truth, always current\\n- **marketplace.json**: Generally accurate, missing 2 entries\\n\\n### Medium Quality Sources\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: User-facing documentation, but consistently outdated\\n- Contains contradictory information (dual version listings)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Trail\\n\\n**Files Analyzed**:\\n- 12 plugin.json files (via find command)\\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md\\n\\n**Analysis Method**:\\n- Direct file reading with Read tool\\n- Manual comparison across all three sources\\n- Line number references for exact location of inconsistencies\\n\\n**Confidence**: High (10/10) - Direct file access, explicit version strings, clear mismatches\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 8 out of 10 plugins have version mismatches, with CLAUDE.md consistently outdated and 2 plugins missing from marketplace.json entirely\\nKEY_ISSUES: CLAUDE.md contains contradictory version numbers for same plugins, frontend and bun missing from marketplace.json, documentation drift indicates release checklist not being followed\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":155,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":35256,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":155,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":25,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXygvm4UL3SGq6Vc2kuSU\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.384Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"uuid\":\"f3a9bfed-990d-4d6e-9d75-6e9770c9434c\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"f3a9bfed-990d-4d6e-9d75-6e9770c9434c\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"uuid\":\"9856e400-e309-4406-b5a1-ef44f2577a1f\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-143600-391f4a6b/gemini-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"58e14333-08a0-400e-be88-1a545d1dc29d\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\"}\n</output>"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d","uuid":"df394014-c525-435f-a6c4-ad414d403c5a","tool_use_result":{"retrieval_status":"success","task":{"task_id":"af41093","task_type":"local_agent","status":"completed","description":"Gemini Pro vote","output":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"PROXY_MODE: google/gemini-3-pro-preview\\n\\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nCheck plugin version numbers -

Bun Backend Plugin\\n- **plugin.json**: 1.6.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: (NOT LISTED in marketplace.json)\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: v1.5.2 (line 20 and line 218)\\n- **Issue**: Missing from marketplace.json entirely, CLAUDE.md outdated\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Plugins NOT Found in plugin.json\\n\\nThe following plugins appear in marketplace.json but have no corresponding plugin.json files found:\\n\\n- **autopilot**: Listed in bash output but not in marketplace.json or CLAUDE.md\\n- **instantly**: Listed in bash output but not in marketplace.json or CLAUDE.md\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues Identified\\n\\n### 1. **Documentation Drift (CLAUDE.md)**\\n- CLAUDE.md serves as the primary user-facing documentation\\n- 8 out of 10 documented plugins have outdated version numbers\\n- Some plugins (code-analysis, agentdev) list MULTIPLE conflicting versions within the same file\\n- This creates confusion for users checking current versions\\n\\n### 2. **Marketplace Completeness**\\n- **frontend** and **bun** plugins are MISSING from marketplace.json entirely\\n- These are production plugins actively maintained but not available via the marketplace\\n- Users cannot install these via `/plugin marketplace add MadAppGang/claude-code`\\n\\n### 3. **Version Sync Pattern**\\n- Pattern observed: plugin.json and marketplace.json are generally in sync\\n- CLAUDE.md consistently lags behind by 1-3 versions\\n- Suggests documentation updates are not part of the release checklist\\n\\n### 4. **CLAUDE.md Dual Version Problem**\\nLines 14-27 contain a table with versions\\nLines 214-224 contain \\\"Current Versions:\\\" list with different versions\\n\\nExample contradictions:\\n- Code Analysis: v3.0.0 (table) vs v2.15.0 (current versions)\\n- Agent Development: v1.3.0 (table) vs v1.4.0 (current versions)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Update CLAUDE.md table (lines 14-27)** with current versions:\\n   - Code Analysis: v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\\n   - Agent Development: v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\\n   - SEO: v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\\n   - Video Editing: v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\\n   - Nanobanana: v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\\n   - Conductor: v2.0.1 → v2.1.0\\n   - Frontend: v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\\n   - Bun: v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\\n   - Dev: v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\\n   - Multimodel: v2.0.0 → v2.2.0\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224)** to match\\n\\n3. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json**:\\n   - frontend (version 3.14.0)\\n   - bun (version 1.6.0)\\n\\n4. **Investigate autopilot and instantly plugins**:\\n   - These have plugin.json files but aren't documented anywhere\\n   - Decision needed: include in marketplace or remove from repo\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Automated Version Validation**:\\n   - Add pre-commit hook to verify version consistency\\n   - Script to compare plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md\\n\\n2. **Release Checklist Enhancement**:\\n   - The existing checklist (lines 247-252) mentions all 3 locations\\n   - But clearly not being followed consistently\\n   - Consider adding automated check that blocks release without all 3 updates\\n\\n3. **Single Source of Truth**:\\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from marketplace.json\\n   - Reduces manual sync burden\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Source Quality Assessment\\n\\n### High Quality Sources\\n- **plugin.json files**: Primary source of truth, always current\\n- **marketplace.json**: Generally accurate, missing 2 entries\\n\\n### Medium Quality Sources\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: User-facing documentation, but consistently outdated\\n- Contains contradictory information (dual version listings)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Trail\\n\\n**Files Analyzed**:\\n- 12 plugin.json files (via find command)\\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md\\n\\n**Analysis Method**:\\n- Direct file reading with Read tool\\n- Manual comparison across all three sources\\n- Line number references for exact location of inconsistencies\\n\\n**Confidence**: High (10/10) - Direct file access, explicit version strings, clear mismatches\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 8 out of 10 plugins have version mismatches, with CLAUDE.md consistently outdated and 2 plugins missing from marketplace.json entirely\\nKEY_ISSUES: CLAUDE.md contains contradictory version numbers for same plugins, frontend and bun missing from marketplace.json, documentation drift indicates release checklist not being followed\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":155,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":35256,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":155,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":25,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXygvm4UL3SGq6Vc2kuSU\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.384Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"uuid\":\"f3a9bfed-990d-4d6e-9d75-6e9770c9434c\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"f3a9bfed-990d-4d6e-9d75-6e9770c9434c\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"uuid\":\"9856e400-e309-4406-b5a1-ef44f2577a1f\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-143600-391f4a6b/gemini-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"58e14333-08a0-400e-be88-1a545d1dc29d\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: google/gemini-3-pro-preview\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nCheck plugin version numbers -

Bun Backend Plugin\\n- **plugin.json**: 1.6.0\\n- **marketplace.json**: (NOT LISTED in marketplace.json)\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: v1.5.2 (line 20 and line 218)\\n- **Issue**: Missing from marketplace.json entirely, CLAUDE.md outdated\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Plugins NOT Found in plugin.json\\n\\nThe following plugins appear in marketplace.json but have no corresponding plugin.json files found:\\n\\n- **autopilot**: Listed in bash output but not in marketplace.json or CLAUDE.md\\n- **instantly**: Listed in bash output but not in marketplace.json or CLAUDE.md\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Critical Issues Identified\\n\\n### 1. **Documentation Drift (CLAUDE.md)**\\n- CLAUDE.md serves as the primary user-facing documentation\\n- 8 out of 10 documented plugins have outdated version numbers\\n- Some plugins (code-analysis, agentdev) list MULTIPLE conflicting versions within the same file\\n- This creates confusion for users checking current versions\\n\\n### 2. **Marketplace Completeness**\\n- **frontend** and **bun** plugins are MISSING from marketplace.json entirely\\n- These are production plugins actively maintained but not available via the marketplace\\n- Users cannot install these via `/plugin marketplace add MadAppGang/claude-code`\\n\\n### 3. **Version Sync Pattern**\\n- Pattern observed: plugin.json and marketplace.json are generally in sync\\n- CLAUDE.md consistently lags behind by 1-3 versions\\n- Suggests documentation updates are not part of the release checklist\\n\\n### 4. **CLAUDE.md Dual Version Problem**\\nLines 14-27 contain a table with versions\\nLines 214-224 contain \\\"Current Versions:\\\" list with different versions\\n\\nExample contradictions:\\n- Code Analysis: v3.0.0 (table) vs v2.15.0 (current versions)\\n- Agent Development: v1.3.0 (table) vs v1.4.0 (current versions)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Immediate Actions Required\\n\\n1. **Update CLAUDE.md table (lines 14-27)** with current versions:\\n   - Code Analysis: v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\\n   - Agent Development: v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\\n   - SEO: v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\\n   - Video Editing: v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\\n   - Nanobanana: v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\\n   - Conductor: v2.0.1 → v2.1.0\\n   - Frontend: v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\\n   - Bun: v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\\n   - Dev: v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\\n   - Multimodel: v2.0.0 → v2.2.0\\n\\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md \\\"Current Versions\\\" section (lines 214-224)** to match\\n\\n3. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json**:\\n   - frontend (version 3.14.0)\\n   - bun (version 1.6.0)\\n\\n4. **Investigate autopilot and instantly plugins**:\\n   - These have plugin.json files but aren't documented anywhere\\n   - Decision needed: include in marketplace or remove from repo\\n\\n### Process Improvements\\n\\n1. **Automated Version Validation**:\\n   - Add pre-commit hook to verify version consistency\\n   - Script to compare plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md\\n\\n2. **Release Checklist Enhancement**:\\n   - The existing checklist (lines 247-252) mentions all 3 locations\\n   - But clearly not being followed consistently\\n   - Consider adding automated check that blocks release without all 3 updates\\n\\n3. **Single Source of Truth**:\\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from marketplace.json\\n   - Reduces manual sync burden\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Source Quality Assessment\\n\\n### High Quality Sources\\n- **plugin.json files**: Primary source of truth, always current\\n- **marketplace.json**: Generally accurate, missing 2 entries\\n\\n### Medium Quality Sources\\n- **CLAUDE.md**: User-facing documentation, but consistently outdated\\n- Contains contradictory information (dual version listings)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Trail\\n\\n**Files Analyzed**:\\n- 12 plugin.json files (via find command)\\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md\\n\\n**Analysis Method**:\\n- Direct file reading with Read tool\\n- Manual comparison across all three sources\\n- Line number references for exact location of inconsistencies\\n\\n**Confidence**: High (10/10) - Direct file access, explicit version strings, clear mismatches\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 10\\nSUMMARY: 8 out of 10 plugins have version mismatches, with CLAUDE.md consistently outdated and 2 plugins missing from marketplace.json entirely\\nKEY_ISSUES: CLAUDE.md contains contradictory version numbers for same plugins, frontend and bun missing from marketplace.json, documentation drift indicates release checklist not being followed\\n```\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":155,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":35256,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":155,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":25,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXygvm4UL3SGq6Vc2kuSU\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.384Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"uuid\":\"f3a9bfed-990d-4d6e-9d75-6e9770c9434c\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"f3a9bfed-990d-4d6e-9d75-6e9770c9434c\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"uuid\":\"9856e400-e309-4406-b5a1-ef44f2577a1f\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"ca5be161-86be-4a3c-b60d-34feb71c445d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"af41093\",\"slug\":\"shiny-pondering-valiant\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01MSpJJzwHXnYEoGAfffayGA\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-check-plugin-version-20260210-143600-391f4a6b/gemini-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"58e14333-08a0-400e-be88-1a545d1dc29d\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:37:15.387Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"6128389b-0017-410b-a0c1-55f538b7fc59\"}\n"}}}

Multiple plugins have inconsistent version numbers between their actual plugin.json files, the marketplace.json manifest, and the CLAUDE.md documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Version Comparison Table\n\n| Plugin | plugin.json | marketplace.json | CLAUDE.md | Status |\n|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------|\n| **code-analysis** | 3.2.0 | 3.2.0 | **v2.15.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **multimodel** | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0 | **v2.0.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **agentdev** | 1.5.0 | 1.5.0 | **v1.4.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **seo** | 1.6.0 | 1.6.0 | **v1.5.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **video-editing** | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | **v1.0.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **nanobanana** | 2.3.0 | 2.3.0 | **v2.2.3** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **conductor** | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 | **v2.0.1** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **dev** | 1.29.0 | 1.29.0 | **v1.26.0** | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **frontend** | **3.14.0** | **NOT FOUND** | v3.13.0 | ❌ MISMATCH |\n| **bun** | **1.6.0** | **NOT FOUND** | v1.5.2 | ❌ MISMATCH |\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues Identified\n\n### Issue 1: CLAUDE.md Documentation is Severely Outdated\n**Impact:** HIGH\n\nThe CLAUDE.md file (lines 214-224) contains version numbers that are significantly behind the actual plugin versions:\n\n- **code-analysis**: Documented as v2.15.0, actual is 3.2.0 (major version behind)\n- **multimodel**: Documented as v2.0.0, actual is 2.2.0\n- **agentdev**: Documented as v1.4.0, actual is 1.5.0\n- **seo**: Documented as v1.5.1, actual is 1.6.0\n- **video-editing**: Documented as v1.0.1, actual is 1.1.0\n- **nanobanana**: Documented as v2.2.3, actual is 2.3.0\n- **conductor**: Documented as v2.0.1, actual is 2.1.0\n- **dev**: Documented as v1.26.0, actual is 1.29.0\n- **frontend**: Documented as v3.13.0, actual is 3.14.0\n- **bun**: Documented as v1.5.2, actual is 1.6.0\n\n### Issue 2: Missing Plugins in marketplace.json\n**Impact:** CRITICAL\n\nTwo plugins are completely missing from the marketplace.json file:\n\n1. **frontend** - Has plugin.json (v3.14.0) but no marketplace entry\n2. **bun** - Has plugin.json (v1.6.0) but no marketplace entry\n\nThis means these plugins cannot be discovered or installed via the Claude Code plugin marketplace.\n\n### Issue 3: Table Inconsistency in CLAUDE.md\n**Impact:** MEDIUM\n\nThe CLAUDE.md file contains a plugin table (lines 16-26) that shows:\n- **Code Analysis** as v3.0.0 (should be 3.2.0)\n- **Dev** as v1.26.0 (should be 1.29.0)\n\nPlus it references \"Orchestration v0.8.2\" which doesn't exist as a separate plugin (this appears to be legacy naming for the multimodel plugin).\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### Source 1: plugin.json Files (Actual Versions)\nLocated in `plugins/*/plugin.json`, these are the source of truth for actual plugin versions:\n\n```\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0\nmultimodel:      2.2.0\nagentdev:        1.5.0\nseo:             1.6.0\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0\nnanobanana:      2.3.0\nconductor:       2.1.0\ndev:             1.29.0\nfrontend:        3.14.0\nbun:             1.6.0\n```\n\n### Source 2: marketplace.json (Marketplace Registry)\nLocated in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:\n\n```\ncode-analysis:   3.2.0  ✓\nmultimodel:      2.2.0  ✓\nagentdev:        1.5.0  ✓\nseo:             1.6.0  ✓\nvideo-editing:   1.1.0  ✓\nnanobanana:      2.3.0  ✓\nconductor:       2.1.0  ✓\ndev:             1.29.0  ✓\nfrontend:        [MISSING]  ❌\nbun:             [MISSING]  ❌\n```\n\n### Source 3: CLAUDE.md (Documentation)\nLocated in `CLAUDE.md` lines 214-224:\n\n```\nMultimodel:           v2.0.0   ❌ (actual: 2.2.0)\nFrontend:             v3.13.0  ❌ (actual: 3.14.0)\nCode Analysis:        v2.15.0  ❌ (actual: 3.2.0)\nBun Backend:          v1.5.2   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\nAgent Development:    v1.4.0   ❌ (actual: 1.5.0)\nSEO:                  v1.5.1   ❌ (actual: 1.6.0)\nVideo Editing:        v1.0.1   ❌ (actual: 1.1.0)\nNanobanana:           v2.2.3   ❌ (actual: 2.3.0)\nConductor:            v2.0.1   ❌ (actual: 2.1.0)\nDev:                  v1.29.0  ✓ (matches!)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Impact Analysis\n\n### For Users\n- **CLAUDE.md serves as the primary reference** - users will see incorrect version numbers\n- **Missing marketplace entries** mean frontend and bun plugins cannot be installed via standard methods\n- **Git tag references** in CLAUDE.md (lines 234-244) are also likely outdated\n\n### For Maintainers\n- Violates the documented release checklist (CLAUDE.md lines 247-251) which states ALL THREE must be updated\n- Creates confusion about which version is current\n- Risks users checking out wrong git tags\n\n### For Claudeup Tool\n- Missing marketplace entries break plugin discovery\n- Version mismatches may cause cache invalidation issues\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Actions\n\n### Immediate (Critical)\n1. **Add missing marketplace entries** for frontend and bun plugins\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md version table** (lines 214-224) to match actual versions\n3. **Update CLAUDE.md plugin table** (lines 16-26) to match actual versions\n\n### Follow-up\n1. Verify git tags match actual plugin versions\n2. Update \"Last Updated\" date in CLAUDE.md (currently Feb 3, 2026)\n3. Consider adding automated version consistency checks to CI/CD\n\n### Process Improvement\n1. The release checklist exists but appears not to be followed\n2. Consider adding a pre-commit hook or CI check to enforce version consistency\n3. Document the version update order (plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md → git tag)\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Files\n\nAll evidence gathered from:\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/*/plugin.json` (10 plugins checked)\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`\n- `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: REJECT\nCONFIDENCE: 10\nSUMMARY: Critical version mismatches found - all 10 plugins have inconsistent versions between sources, 2 plugins completely missing from marketplace\nKEY_ISSUES: CLAUDE.md versions outdated (10/10 plugins), frontend+bun missing from marketplace.json, major version discrepancy (code-analysis 2.15.0 vs 3.2.0)\n```\n","numLines":175,"startLine":1,"totalLines":175}}}

Bun Backend Plugin\n- **plugin.json**: 1.6.0\n- **marketplace.json**: (NOT LISTED in marketplace.json)\n- **CLAUDE.md**: v1.5.2 (line 20 and line 218)\n- **Issue**: Missing from marketplace.json entirely, CLAUDE.md outdated\n\n---\n\n## Plugins NOT Found in plugin.json\n\nThe following plugins appear in marketplace.json but have no corresponding plugin.json files found:\n\n- **autopilot**: Listed in bash output but not in marketplace.json or CLAUDE.md\n- **instantly**: Listed in bash output but not in marketplace.json or CLAUDE.md\n\n---\n\n## Critical Issues Identified\n\n### 1. **Documentation Drift (CLAUDE.md)**\n- CLAUDE.md serves as the primary user-facing documentation\n- 8 out of 10 documented plugins have outdated version numbers\n- Some plugins (code-analysis, agentdev) list MULTIPLE conflicting versions within the same file\n- This creates confusion for users checking current versions\n\n### 2. **Marketplace Completeness**\n- **frontend** and **bun** plugins are MISSING from marketplace.json entirely\n- These are production plugins actively maintained but not available via the marketplace\n- Users cannot install these via `/plugin marketplace add MadAppGang/claude-code`\n\n### 3. **Version Sync Pattern**\n- Pattern observed: plugin.json and marketplace.json are generally in sync\n- CLAUDE.md consistently lags behind by 1-3 versions\n- Suggests documentation updates are not part of the release checklist\n\n### 4. **CLAUDE.md Dual Version Problem**\nLines 14-27 contain a table with versions\nLines 214-224 contain \"Current Versions:\" list with different versions\n\nExample contradictions:\n- Code Analysis: v3.0.0 (table) vs v2.15.0 (current versions)\n- Agent Development: v1.3.0 (table) vs v1.4.0 (current versions)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions Required\n\n1. **Update CLAUDE.md table (lines 14-27)** with current versions:\n   - Code Analysis: v3.0.0 → v3.2.0\n   - Agent Development: v1.3.0 → v1.5.0\n   - SEO: v1.5.1 → v1.6.0\n   - Video Editing: v1.0.1 → v1.1.0\n   - Nanobanana: v2.2.3 → v2.3.0\n   - Conductor: v2.0.1 → v2.1.0\n   - Frontend: v3.13.0 → v3.14.0\n   - Bun: v1.5.2 → v1.6.0\n   - Dev: v1.26.0 → v1.29.0\n   - Multimodel: v2.0.0 → v2.2.0\n\n2. **Update CLAUDE.md \"Current Versions\" section (lines 214-224)** to match\n\n3. **Add missing plugins to marketplace.json**:\n   - frontend (version 3.14.0)\n   - bun (version 1.6.0)\n\n4. **Investigate autopilot and instantly plugins**:\n   - These have plugin.json files but aren't documented anywhere\n   - Decision needed: include in marketplace or remove from repo\n\n### Process Improvements\n\n1. **Automated Version Validation**:\n   - Add pre-commit hook to verify version consistency\n   - Script to compare plugin.json → marketplace.json → CLAUDE.md\n\n2. **Release Checklist Enhancement**:\n   - The existing checklist (lines 247-252) mentions all 3 locations\n   - But clearly not being followed consistently\n   - Consider adding automated check that blocks release without all 3 updates\n\n3. **Single Source of Truth**:\n   - Consider generating CLAUDE.md version table from marketplace.json\n   - Reduces manual sync burden\n\n---\n\n## Source Quality Assessment\n\n### High Quality Sources\n- **plugin.json files**: Primary source of truth, always current\n- **marketplace.json**: Generally accurate, missing 2 entries\n\n### Medium Quality Sources\n- **CLAUDE.md**: User-facing documentation, but consistently outdated\n- Contains contradictory information (dual version listings)\n\n---\n\n## Evidence Trail\n\n**Files Analyzed**:\n- 12 plugin.json files (via find command)\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json\n- /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/CLAUDE.md\n\n**Analysis Method**:\n- Direct file reading with Read tool\n- Manual comparison across all three sources\n- Line number references for exact location of inconsistencies\n\n**Confidence**: High (10/10) - Direct file access, explicit version strings, clear mismatches\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: REJECT\nCONFIDENCE: 10\nSUMMARY: 8 out of 10 plugins have version mismatches, with CLAUDE.md consistently outdated and 2 plugins missing from marketplace.json entirely\nKEY_ISSUES: CLAUDE.md contains contradictory version numbers for same plugins, frontend and bun missing from marketplace.json, documentation drift indicates release checklist not being followed\n```\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}
