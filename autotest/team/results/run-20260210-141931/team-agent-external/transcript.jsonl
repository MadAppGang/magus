The manifest correctly declares 15 agents, 12 commands, and 42+ skills with proper metadata and versioning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Structure & Organization\\n\\n✅ **STRENGTHS:**\\n- Clean, readable JSON structure\\n- Proper metadata fields (name, version, description, author, license)\\n- Comprehensive keywords array (42 entries covering all technology stacks)\\n- Correct category classification (\\\"development\\\")\\n- Valid compatibility declaration (`claudeCode: \\\">=0.1.0\\\"`)\\n- Dependency declaration for multimodel plugin (`^2.0.0`)\\n\\n✅ **CONVENTIONS FOLLOWED:**\\n- Relative paths for all components (`./agents/`, `./commands/`, `./skills/`)\\n- MCP servers externalized to `./.mcp.json`\\n- Output styles properly declared (`./output-styles/self-improving.md`)\\n- Skills use directory-based structure (no `.md` extension)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. File-to-Manifest Mapping\\n\\nI verified actual file system structure against the manifest:\\n\\n| Component Type | Declared in Manifest | Actual Files | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| **Agents** | 15 | 16 | ⚠️ **MISMATCH** |\\n| **Commands** | 12 | 13 | ⚠️ **MISMATCH** |\\n| **Skills** | 42 | 16 | ✅ **CORRECT** (nested structure) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Missing Declarations\\n\\n#### 3.1 Missing Agent: `test-architect.md`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Manifest declares 15 agents (lines 45-61)\\n- Actual directory contains **16 agents**\\n- Missing from manifest: `./agents/test-architect.md`\\n\\n**Impact:** The test-architect agent exists in the file system but is not registered in the plugin manifest, making it invisible to Claude Code's plugin loader.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Missing Command: `delegate.md`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Manifest declares 12 commands (lines 62-75)\\n- Actual directory contains **13 commands**\\n- Missing from manifest: `./commands/delegate.md`\\n\\n**Impact:** The `/dev:delegate` command (referenced in CLAUDE.md's Task Routing section) is not registered and cannot be invoked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Version & Description Accuracy\\n\\n✅ **VERSION:** `1.29.0` matches CLAUDE.md documentation\\n\\n⚠️ **DESCRIPTION DISCREPANCY:**\\n- Manifest claims: **\\\"45 skills\\\"**\\n- Actual skills array: **42 entries** (lines 79-124)\\n\\nThe count includes:\\n- 16 skill directories in file system\\n- Some skills are nested (e.g., `./skills/core/universal-patterns` + `./skills/core/testing-strategies`)\\n- Description should say **\\\"42 skill entries\\\"** or recount nested structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Skill Path Structure\\n\\n✅ **CORRECT PATTERNS:**\\nAll skills use directory-based paths without `.md` extensions:\\n```json\\n\\\"./skills/context-detection\\\",\\n\\\"./skills/core/universal-patterns\\\",\\n\\\"./skills/backend/golang\\\",\\n```\\n\\nThis matches Claude Code plugin SDK expectations where each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` file.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. MCP Server Configuration\\n\\n✅ **EXTERNALIZED CORRECTLY:**\\n- `\\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"` points to external configuration\\n- Verified file exists: `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/.mcp.json`\\n\\nThis follows best practices for separating MCP configuration from the main manifest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Dependencies & Compatibility\\n\\n✅ **DEPENDENCIES:**\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nCorrectly declares dependency on multimodel plugin (current version 2.2.0 satisfies `^2.0.0`).\\n\\n✅ **COMPATIBILITY:**\\n```json\\n\\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n  \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nStandard compatibility declaration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 8. Author & License Metadata\\n\\n✅ **COMPLETE:**\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nFull author object (more detailed than multimodel plugin's string-only format).\\n\\n✅ **LICENSE:** MIT (consistent with repository)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 9. Optional Fields Comparison\\n\\nComparing against other MAG plugins:\\n\\n| Field | Dev Plugin | Multimodel Plugin | Frontend Plugin |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| `homepage` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present | ❌ Missing |\\n| `tags` | ❌ (uses `keywords`) | ✅ Present | ❌ (uses `keywords`) |\\n| `hooks` | ✅ Present (directory) | ✅ Present (JSON) | ❌ Missing |\\n| `skillBundles` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present | ❌ Missing |\\n\\n**Observations:**\\n- Dev plugin uses `keywords` instead of `tags` (both are valid)\\n- Missing `homepage` field (optional but useful for marketplace)\\n- No `skillBundles` defined (could improve skill organization for large plugin)\\n- Hooks directory exists but not declared in manifest\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 10. Hooks Configuration\\n\\n⚠️ **INCONSISTENCY:**\\n- Directory `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/hooks/` exists\\n- **NOT declared in manifest** (no `\\\"hooks\\\"` field)\\n- Multimodel plugin declares hooks: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n\\n**Impact:** If hooks are intended to be active, they need to be registered in the manifest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1 - Critical (Blocking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Add missing agent declaration:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Insert after line 56 (after `./agents/synthesizer.md`)\\n\\n2. **Add missing command declaration:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Insert after line 65 (after `./commands/debug.md`)\\n\\n### Priority 2 - Important (Should Fix)\\n\\n3. **Correct skill count in description:**\\n   - Change \\\"45 skills\\\" → \\\"42 skill entries\\\" or recount including nested skills\\n\\n4. **Add hooks field if hooks are active:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n   ```\\n   (Only if hooks are intended to be loaded)\\n\\n### Priority 3 - Nice to Have\\n\\n5. **Add homepage field:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Consider skill bundles for 42-skill organization:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n     \\\"core\\\": [\\\"context-detection\\\", \\\"core/universal-patterns\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"frontend\\\": [\\\"frontend/react-typescript\\\", \\\"frontend/vue-typescript\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"backend\\\": [\\\"backend/golang\\\", \\\"backend/bunjs\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"discipline\\\": [\\\"discipline/verification-before-completion\\\", ...]\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison to Plugin Standards\\n\\nBased on analysis of multimodel and frontend plugins:\\n\\n| Criterion | Dev Plugin | Standard | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Proper metadata | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n| Relative paths | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n| Version format | ✅ | Semantic | PASS |\\n| File-manifest sync | ⚠️ | Required | **FAIL** (2 missing) |\\n| Skill path format | ✅ | Directory-based | PASS |\\n| MCP externalization | ✅ | Best practice | PASS |\\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Two critical missing declarations (test-architect agent, delegate command) break file-manifest integrity; skill count discrepancy in description.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing test-architect.md agent declaration, Missing delegate.md command declaration, Incorrect skill count (claims 45, has 42), Hooks directory not registered in manifest\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Summary\\n\\n**Missing Agent:**\\n```bash\\n$ ls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/ | wc -l\\n16\\n# Manifest declares only 15\\n```\\n\\n**Missing Command:**\\n```bash\\n$ ls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/\\n...\\ndelegate.md  # Not in manifest\\n...\\n```\\n\\n**Skill Count:**\\n```bash\\n$ grep -c '\\\".\\\\/skills\\\\/' plugins/dev/plugin.json\\n42\\n# Description claims 45\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound** with proper conventions, but fails integrity validation due to **2 missing component declarations** and **1 documentation inaccuracy**. These are straightforward fixes that would bring the manifest to full compliance.\\n\\nThe plugin demonstrates good practices in:\\n- Path consistency\\n- MCP externalization\\n- Dependency management\\n- Metadata completeness\\n\\nWith the recommended fixes, this would be a **high-quality plugin manifest**.\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":2023,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":21824,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":2023,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyftYJqoQzkW4umYUH12\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.707Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"uuid\":\"1a6fdb9c-2394-4e0e-a176-5c9c662fecc5\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"1a6fdb9c-2394-4e0e-a176-5c9c662fecc5\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"uuid\":\"4d2e4a6b-884c-4385-8b84-8ef07923b415\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-142226-7eef2e08/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"675d633f-344c-459c-b426-5050333c98f4\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\"}\n</output>"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d","uuid":"16ab2078-6dd5-4d30-8a3f-1016fc040400","tool_use_result":{"retrieval_status":"success","task":{"task_id":"ad35134","task_type":"local_agent","status":"completed","description":"Grok vote on dev plugin.json","output":"{\"parentUuid\":null,\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\\n\\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\\n\\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\\n\\n### Task\\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

The manifest correctly declares 15 agents, 12 commands, and 42+ skills with proper metadata and versioning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Structure & Organization\\n\\n✅ **STRENGTHS:**\\n- Clean, readable JSON structure\\n- Proper metadata fields (name, version, description, author, license)\\n- Comprehensive keywords array (42 entries covering all technology stacks)\\n- Correct category classification (\\\"development\\\")\\n- Valid compatibility declaration (`claudeCode: \\\">=0.1.0\\\"`)\\n- Dependency declaration for multimodel plugin (`^2.0.0`)\\n\\n✅ **CONVENTIONS FOLLOWED:**\\n- Relative paths for all components (`./agents/`, `./commands/`, `./skills/`)\\n- MCP servers externalized to `./.mcp.json`\\n- Output styles properly declared (`./output-styles/self-improving.md`)\\n- Skills use directory-based structure (no `.md` extension)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. File-to-Manifest Mapping\\n\\nI verified actual file system structure against the manifest:\\n\\n| Component Type | Declared in Manifest | Actual Files | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| **Agents** | 15 | 16 | ⚠️ **MISMATCH** |\\n| **Commands** | 12 | 13 | ⚠️ **MISMATCH** |\\n| **Skills** | 42 | 16 | ✅ **CORRECT** (nested structure) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Missing Declarations\\n\\n#### 3.1 Missing Agent: `test-architect.md`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Manifest declares 15 agents (lines 45-61)\\n- Actual directory contains **16 agents**\\n- Missing from manifest: `./agents/test-architect.md`\\n\\n**Impact:** The test-architect agent exists in the file system but is not registered in the plugin manifest, making it invisible to Claude Code's plugin loader.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Missing Command: `delegate.md`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Manifest declares 12 commands (lines 62-75)\\n- Actual directory contains **13 commands**\\n- Missing from manifest: `./commands/delegate.md`\\n\\n**Impact:** The `/dev:delegate` command (referenced in CLAUDE.md's Task Routing section) is not registered and cannot be invoked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Version & Description Accuracy\\n\\n✅ **VERSION:** `1.29.0` matches CLAUDE.md documentation\\n\\n⚠️ **DESCRIPTION DISCREPANCY:**\\n- Manifest claims: **\\\"45 skills\\\"**\\n- Actual skills array: **42 entries** (lines 79-124)\\n\\nThe count includes:\\n- 16 skill directories in file system\\n- Some skills are nested (e.g., `./skills/core/universal-patterns` + `./skills/core/testing-strategies`)\\n- Description should say **\\\"42 skill entries\\\"** or recount nested structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Skill Path Structure\\n\\n✅ **CORRECT PATTERNS:**\\nAll skills use directory-based paths without `.md` extensions:\\n```json\\n\\\"./skills/context-detection\\\",\\n\\\"./skills/core/universal-patterns\\\",\\n\\\"./skills/backend/golang\\\",\\n```\\n\\nThis matches Claude Code plugin SDK expectations where each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` file.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. MCP Server Configuration\\n\\n✅ **EXTERNALIZED CORRECTLY:**\\n- `\\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"` points to external configuration\\n- Verified file exists: `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/.mcp.json`\\n\\nThis follows best practices for separating MCP configuration from the main manifest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Dependencies & Compatibility\\n\\n✅ **DEPENDENCIES:**\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nCorrectly declares dependency on multimodel plugin (current version 2.2.0 satisfies `^2.0.0`).\\n\\n✅ **COMPATIBILITY:**\\n```json\\n\\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n  \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nStandard compatibility declaration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 8. Author & License Metadata\\n\\n✅ **COMPLETE:**\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nFull author object (more detailed than multimodel plugin's string-only format).\\n\\n✅ **LICENSE:** MIT (consistent with repository)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 9. Optional Fields Comparison\\n\\nComparing against other MAG plugins:\\n\\n| Field | Dev Plugin | Multimodel Plugin | Frontend Plugin |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| `homepage` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present | ❌ Missing |\\n| `tags` | ❌ (uses `keywords`) | ✅ Present | ❌ (uses `keywords`) |\\n| `hooks` | ✅ Present (directory) | ✅ Present (JSON) | ❌ Missing |\\n| `skillBundles` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present | ❌ Missing |\\n\\n**Observations:**\\n- Dev plugin uses `keywords` instead of `tags` (both are valid)\\n- Missing `homepage` field (optional but useful for marketplace)\\n- No `skillBundles` defined (could improve skill organization for large plugin)\\n- Hooks directory exists but not declared in manifest\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 10. Hooks Configuration\\n\\n⚠️ **INCONSISTENCY:**\\n- Directory `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/hooks/` exists\\n- **NOT declared in manifest** (no `\\\"hooks\\\"` field)\\n- Multimodel plugin declares hooks: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n\\n**Impact:** If hooks are intended to be active, they need to be registered in the manifest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1 - Critical (Blocking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Add missing agent declaration:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Insert after line 56 (after `./agents/synthesizer.md`)\\n\\n2. **Add missing command declaration:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Insert after line 65 (after `./commands/debug.md`)\\n\\n### Priority 2 - Important (Should Fix)\\n\\n3. **Correct skill count in description:**\\n   - Change \\\"45 skills\\\" → \\\"42 skill entries\\\" or recount including nested skills\\n\\n4. **Add hooks field if hooks are active:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n   ```\\n   (Only if hooks are intended to be loaded)\\n\\n### Priority 3 - Nice to Have\\n\\n5. **Add homepage field:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Consider skill bundles for 42-skill organization:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n     \\\"core\\\": [\\\"context-detection\\\", \\\"core/universal-patterns\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"frontend\\\": [\\\"frontend/react-typescript\\\", \\\"frontend/vue-typescript\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"backend\\\": [\\\"backend/golang\\\", \\\"backend/bunjs\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"discipline\\\": [\\\"discipline/verification-before-completion\\\", ...]\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison to Plugin Standards\\n\\nBased on analysis of multimodel and frontend plugins:\\n\\n| Criterion | Dev Plugin | Standard | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Proper metadata | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n| Relative paths | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n| Version format | ✅ | Semantic | PASS |\\n| File-manifest sync | ⚠️ | Required | **FAIL** (2 missing) |\\n| Skill path format | ✅ | Directory-based | PASS |\\n| MCP externalization | ✅ | Best practice | PASS |\\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Two critical missing declarations (test-architect agent, delegate command) break file-manifest integrity; skill count discrepancy in description.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing test-architect.md agent declaration, Missing delegate.md command declaration, Incorrect skill count (claims 45, has 42), Hooks directory not registered in manifest\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Summary\\n\\n**Missing Agent:**\\n```bash\\n$ ls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/ | wc -l\\n16\\n# Manifest declares only 15\\n```\\n\\n**Missing Command:**\\n```bash\\n$ ls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/\\n...\\ndelegate.md  # Not in manifest\\n...\\n```\\n\\n**Skill Count:**\\n```bash\\n$ grep -c '\\\".\\\\/skills\\\\/' plugins/dev/plugin.json\\n42\\n# Description claims 45\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound** with proper conventions, but fails integrity validation due to **2 missing component declarations** and **1 documentation inaccuracy**. These are straightforward fixes that would bring the manifest to full compliance.\\n\\nThe plugin demonstrates good practices in:\\n- Path consistency\\n- MCP externalization\\n- Dependency management\\n- Metadata completeness\\n\\nWith the recommended fixes, this would be a **high-quality plugin manifest**.\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":2023,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":21824,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":2023,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyftYJqoQzkW4umYUH12\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.707Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"uuid\":\"1a6fdb9c-2394-4e0e-a176-5c9c662fecc5\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"1a6fdb9c-2394-4e0e-a176-5c9c662fecc5\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"uuid\":\"4d2e4a6b-884c-4385-8b84-8ef07923b415\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-142226-7eef2e08/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"675d633f-344c-459c-b426-5050333c98f4\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\"}\n","prompt":"PROXY_MODE: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1\n\n## Team Vote: Independent Review Request\n\nYou are a team member evaluating the following task independently.\nProvide YOUR OWN assessment based solely on the evidence.\n\n### Task\nReview the plugin.json structure in the dev plugin.

The manifest correctly declares 15 agents, 12 commands, and 42+ skills with proper metadata and versioning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Detailed Analysis\\n\\n### 1. Structure & Organization\\n\\n✅ **STRENGTHS:**\\n- Clean, readable JSON structure\\n- Proper metadata fields (name, version, description, author, license)\\n- Comprehensive keywords array (42 entries covering all technology stacks)\\n- Correct category classification (\\\"development\\\")\\n- Valid compatibility declaration (`claudeCode: \\\">=0.1.0\\\"`)\\n- Dependency declaration for multimodel plugin (`^2.0.0`)\\n\\n✅ **CONVENTIONS FOLLOWED:**\\n- Relative paths for all components (`./agents/`, `./commands/`, `./skills/`)\\n- MCP servers externalized to `./.mcp.json`\\n- Output styles properly declared (`./output-styles/self-improving.md`)\\n- Skills use directory-based structure (no `.md` extension)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. File-to-Manifest Mapping\\n\\nI verified actual file system structure against the manifest:\\n\\n| Component Type | Declared in Manifest | Actual Files | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| **Agents** | 15 | 16 | ⚠️ **MISMATCH** |\\n| **Commands** | 12 | 13 | ⚠️ **MISMATCH** |\\n| **Skills** | 42 | 16 | ✅ **CORRECT** (nested structure) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Missing Declarations\\n\\n#### 3.1 Missing Agent: `test-architect.md`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Manifest declares 15 agents (lines 45-61)\\n- Actual directory contains **16 agents**\\n- Missing from manifest: `./agents/test-architect.md`\\n\\n**Impact:** The test-architect agent exists in the file system but is not registered in the plugin manifest, making it invisible to Claude Code's plugin loader.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Missing Command: `delegate.md`\\n\\n**Evidence:**\\n- Manifest declares 12 commands (lines 62-75)\\n- Actual directory contains **13 commands**\\n- Missing from manifest: `./commands/delegate.md`\\n\\n**Impact:** The `/dev:delegate` command (referenced in CLAUDE.md's Task Routing section) is not registered and cannot be invoked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Version & Description Accuracy\\n\\n✅ **VERSION:** `1.29.0` matches CLAUDE.md documentation\\n\\n⚠️ **DESCRIPTION DISCREPANCY:**\\n- Manifest claims: **\\\"45 skills\\\"**\\n- Actual skills array: **42 entries** (lines 79-124)\\n\\nThe count includes:\\n- 16 skill directories in file system\\n- Some skills are nested (e.g., `./skills/core/universal-patterns` + `./skills/core/testing-strategies`)\\n- Description should say **\\\"42 skill entries\\\"** or recount nested structure\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Skill Path Structure\\n\\n✅ **CORRECT PATTERNS:**\\nAll skills use directory-based paths without `.md` extensions:\\n```json\\n\\\"./skills/context-detection\\\",\\n\\\"./skills/core/universal-patterns\\\",\\n\\\"./skills/backend/golang\\\",\\n```\\n\\nThis matches Claude Code plugin SDK expectations where each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` file.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6. MCP Server Configuration\\n\\n✅ **EXTERNALIZED CORRECTLY:**\\n- `\\\"mcpServers\\\": \\\"./.mcp.json\\\"` points to external configuration\\n- Verified file exists: `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/.mcp.json`\\n\\nThis follows best practices for separating MCP configuration from the main manifest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 7. Dependencies & Compatibility\\n\\n✅ **DEPENDENCIES:**\\n```json\\n\\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n  \\\"multimodel@mag-claude-plugins\\\": \\\"^2.0.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nCorrectly declares dependency on multimodel plugin (current version 2.2.0 satisfies `^2.0.0`).\\n\\n✅ **COMPATIBILITY:**\\n```json\\n\\\"compatibility\\\": {\\n  \\\"claudeCode\\\": \\\">=0.1.0\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nStandard compatibility declaration.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 8. Author & License Metadata\\n\\n✅ **COMPLETE:**\\n```json\\n\\\"author\\\": {\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jack Rudenko\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"i@madappgang.com\\\",\\n  \\\"company\\\": \\\"MadAppGang\\\"\\n}\\n```\\nFull author object (more detailed than multimodel plugin's string-only format).\\n\\n✅ **LICENSE:** MIT (consistent with repository)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 9. Optional Fields Comparison\\n\\nComparing against other MAG plugins:\\n\\n| Field | Dev Plugin | Multimodel Plugin | Frontend Plugin |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| `homepage` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present | ❌ Missing |\\n| `tags` | ❌ (uses `keywords`) | ✅ Present | ❌ (uses `keywords`) |\\n| `hooks` | ✅ Present (directory) | ✅ Present (JSON) | ❌ Missing |\\n| `skillBundles` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Present | ❌ Missing |\\n\\n**Observations:**\\n- Dev plugin uses `keywords` instead of `tags` (both are valid)\\n- Missing `homepage` field (optional but useful for marketplace)\\n- No `skillBundles` defined (could improve skill organization for large plugin)\\n- Hooks directory exists but not declared in manifest\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 10. Hooks Configuration\\n\\n⚠️ **INCONSISTENCY:**\\n- Directory `/Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/hooks/` exists\\n- **NOT declared in manifest** (no `\\\"hooks\\\"` field)\\n- Multimodel plugin declares hooks: `\\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"`\\n\\n**Impact:** If hooks are intended to be active, they need to be registered in the manifest.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\n### Priority 1 - Critical (Blocking Issues)\\n\\n1. **Add missing agent declaration:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./agents/test-architect.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Insert after line 56 (after `./agents/synthesizer.md`)\\n\\n2. **Add missing command declaration:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"./commands/delegate.md\\\"\\n   ```\\n   Insert after line 65 (after `./commands/debug.md`)\\n\\n### Priority 2 - Important (Should Fix)\\n\\n3. **Correct skill count in description:**\\n   - Change \\\"45 skills\\\" → \\\"42 skill entries\\\" or recount including nested skills\\n\\n4. **Add hooks field if hooks are active:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"hooks\\\": \\\"./hooks/hooks.json\\\"\\n   ```\\n   (Only if hooks are intended to be loaded)\\n\\n### Priority 3 - Nice to Have\\n\\n5. **Add homepage field:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"homepage\\\": \\\"https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code\\\"\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Consider skill bundles for 42-skill organization:**\\n   ```json\\n   \\\"skillBundles\\\": {\\n     \\\"core\\\": [\\\"context-detection\\\", \\\"core/universal-patterns\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"frontend\\\": [\\\"frontend/react-typescript\\\", \\\"frontend/vue-typescript\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"backend\\\": [\\\"backend/golang\\\", \\\"backend/bunjs\\\", ...],\\n     \\\"discipline\\\": [\\\"discipline/verification-before-completion\\\", ...]\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Comparison to Plugin Standards\\n\\nBased on analysis of multimodel and frontend plugins:\\n\\n| Criterion | Dev Plugin | Standard | Status |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Proper metadata | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n| Relative paths | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n| Version format | ✅ | Semantic | PASS |\\n| File-manifest sync | ⚠️ | Required | **FAIL** (2 missing) |\\n| Skill path format | ✅ | Directory-based | PASS |\\n| MCP externalization | ✅ | Best practice | PASS |\\n| Dependencies declared | ✅ | Required | PASS |\\n\\n---\\n\\n```vote\\nVERDICT: REJECT\\nCONFIDENCE: 9\\nSUMMARY: Two critical missing declarations (test-architect agent, delegate command) break file-manifest integrity; skill count discrepancy in description.\\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing test-architect.md agent declaration, Missing delegate.md command declaration, Incorrect skill count (claims 45, has 42), Hooks directory not registered in manifest\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evidence Summary\\n\\n**Missing Agent:**\\n```bash\\n$ ls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/agents/ | wc -l\\n16\\n# Manifest declares only 15\\n```\\n\\n**Missing Command:**\\n```bash\\n$ ls /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/plugins/dev/commands/\\n...\\ndelegate.md  # Not in manifest\\n...\\n```\\n\\n**Skill Count:**\\n```bash\\n$ grep -c '\\\".\\\\/skills\\\\/' plugins/dev/plugin.json\\n42\\n# Description claims 45\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe dev plugin's plugin.json is **structurally sound** with proper conventions, but fails integrity validation due to **2 missing component declarations** and **1 documentation inaccuracy**. These are straightforward fixes that would bring the manifest to full compliance.\\n\\nThe plugin demonstrates good practices in:\\n- Path consistency\\n- MCP externalization\\n- Dependency management\\n- Metadata completeness\\n\\nWith the recommended fixes, this would be a **high-quality plugin manifest**.\\n\"}}],\"stop_reason\":null,\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":6,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":2023,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":21824,\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":2023,\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":0},\"output_tokens\":1,\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"inference_geo\":\"not_available\"}},\"requestId\":\"req_011CXyftYJqoQzkW4umYUH12\",\"type\":\"assistant\",\"uuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.707Z\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"bun \\\"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/handler.ts\\\"\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"uuid\":\"1a6fdb9c-2394-4e0e-a176-5c9c662fecc5\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"1a6fdb9c-2394-4e0e-a176-5c9c662fecc5\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"progress\",\"data\":{\"type\":\"hook_progress\",\"hookEvent\":\"PostToolUse\",\"hookName\":\"PostToolUse:Write\",\"command\":\"callback\"},\"parentToolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"toolUseID\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"uuid\":\"4d2e4a6b-884c-4385-8b84-8ef07923b415\"}\n{\"parentUuid\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\",\"isSidechain\":true,\"userType\":\"external\",\"cwd\":\"/Users/jack/mag/claude-code\",\"sessionId\":\"d9f92d00-79ee-46c9-98e7-aa6c3c55e65d\",\"version\":\"2.1.38\",\"gitBranch\":\"main\",\"agentId\":\"ad35134\",\"slug\":\"adaptive-hatching-sun\",\"type\":\"user\",\"message\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_019vjTVL1twsyQAEJgDMGSYh\",\"type\":\"tool_result\",\"content\":\"File created successfully at: /Users/jack/mag/claude-code/ai-docs/sessions/team-review-dev-plugin-js-20260210-142226-7eef2e08/grok-result.md\"}]},\"uuid\":\"675d633f-344c-459c-b426-5050333c98f4\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-10T03:23:48.711Z\",\"sourceToolAssistantUUID\":\"67d28aa5-0140-43c1-9d35-adc197dbbfcb\"}\n"}}}
