Environment Variables\n**Status**: PRESENT - GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Line 532 in plugin description: References DEPENDENCIES.md which documents environment variables\n- Indirect reference through MCP server setup requirements (Figma, Apidog tokens mentioned in plugin descriptions)\n\n**Quality**: Good. Environment variables are documented in linked files rather than inline in README.\n\n**Location**: According to CLAUDE.md context (from system reminder), environment variables are documented in:\n- `.env.example` (mentioned in CLAUDE.md, lines showing required/optional variables)\n- `plugins/frontend/DEPENDENCIES.md` (linked on line 532)\n\n**Assessment**: While not a dedicated section in README, environment variables are appropriately delegated to detailed documentation files. This is acceptable for a marketplace README where different plugins have different requirements.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 7. Contributing Guidelines\n**Status**: PRESENT - ADEQUATE\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 505-507: Community plugin requests process\n- Line 474: Link to `./docs/contributing.md` (dedicated contributing guide)\n\n**Quality**: Adequate. Contributing information exists but is minimal in the main README, delegated to dedicated file.\n\n**Content**:\n- Line 507: \"Have a plugin idea? [Open an issue](https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code/issues) with the `plugin-request` label\"\n- Line 474: Links to comprehensive contributing guide\n\n**Assessment**: Follows best practice of linking to detailed CONTRIBUTING.md rather than bloating README. Provides immediate entry point (issue with label) for casual contributors.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 8. License Information\n**Status**: PRESENT - EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Line 5: Badge showing MIT License with link\n- Lines 536-541: Dedicated \"License\" section\n  - Line 538: Project licensed under MIT\n  - Line 540: Notes that individual plugins may have their own licenses\n\n**Quality**: Excellent. License information visible at top (badge) and detailed in dedicated section. Appropriately notes potential variations for individual plugins.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 9. Requirements/Prerequisites\n**STATUS**: PRESENT - EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 298-312: Dedicated \"Prerequisites\" section under Installation\n  - Claude Code Requirements (lines 299-309): Plugin system requirements, manifest location, settings format\n  - System Requirements (lines 311-312): Claude Code + Git\n\n**Quality**: Excellent. Clear separation of Claude Code plugin requirements vs general system requirements. Includes technical details about plugin format.\n\n**Additional Context**: Line 532 links to DEPENDENCIES.md for plugin-specific dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ 10. Table of Contents\n**STATUS**: MISSING\n\n**Evidence**: No table of contents present at the top of the README.\n\n**Impact**: MODERATE\n- README is 570 lines long\n- Contains multiple major sections\n- Navigation would significantly improve user experience\n- However, GitHub auto-generates navigation from headers (## sections)\n\n**Mitigating Factor**: GitHub's UI provides automatic navigation via header sidebar, partially compensating for missing TOC.\n\n**Assessment**: This is the only missing item from the checklist. While it would improve the document, GitHub's auto-generated navigation reduces the severity of this omission.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Strengths\n\nBeyond the required checklist, the README excels in several areas:\n\n1. **Value Proposition** (lines 8-63): Extensive positioning with quantified business impact\n2. **Update Instructions** (lines 66-75): Dedicated section for existing users\n3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Excellent use of emoji icons, badges, and markdown formatting\n4. **Multiple User Personas**: Content structured for end users, developers, and contributors\n5. **External Links**: Comprehensive documentation structure with links to detailed guides\n6. **Real Examples**: Actual command examples with expected outcomes (not hypothetical)\n7. **Team Workflow**: Explicit documentation of team setup and sync (lines 350-365)\n8. **Verification Steps**: Post-installation verification commands (lines 386-406)\n9. **Troubleshooting Links**: References to troubleshooting documentation\n10. **Community Support**: Multiple contact channels (email, issues, discussions) - lines 560-566\n\n---\n\n## Missing/Weak Areas\n\n### 1. Table of Contents (MISSING - Required Item)\n**Severity**: MODERATE\n**Recommendation**: Add TOC after badges section (after line 6)\n\n**Suggested Structure**:\n```markdown\n## Table of Contents\n- [Quick Start](#-quick-start)\n- [What's Inside](#-whats-inside)\n- [Installation & Setup](#-installation--setup)\n- [Usage Guide](#-usage-guide)\n- [Documentation](#-documentation)\n- [Roadmap](#-roadmap)\n- [License](#-license)\n- [Contact & Support](#-contact--support)\n```\n\n### 2. Environment Variables (WEAK - Delegated)\n**Severity**: MINOR\n**Current**: Documented in separate files (DEPENDENCIES.md, .env.example)\n**Recommendation**: Consider adding a brief \"Environment Variables\" section that lists common variables with links to detailed docs\n\n**Example**:\n```markdown\n## Environment Variables\n\nCommon environment variables (see [DEPENDENCIES.md](./plugins/frontend/DEPENDENCIES.md) for complete list):\n\n- `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Required for Figma integration\n- `APIDOG_API_TOKEN` - Required for API documentation sync\n- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Optional, for enhanced Git operations\n\nFor full configuration, see `.env.example` in the repository root.\n```\n\n### 3. Troubleshooting Section (WEAK - Only Linked)\n**Severity**: MINOR\n**Current**: Line 467 links to troubleshooting doc, line 402 mentions \"Common issues\" with link\n**Recommendation**: Add brief inline troubleshooting section with most common 2-3 issues, link to detailed guide for more\n\n---\n\n## Section Quality Scoring\n\n| Section | Status | Quality | Notes |\n|---------|--------|---------|-------|\n| 1. Project Description | ✅ | EXCELLENT (10/10) | Comprehensive value prop + detailed plugin listing |\n| 2. Installation | ✅ | EXCELLENT (10/10) | Quick start + detailed setup + verification |\n| 3.

Prerequisites | ✅ | EXCELLENT (9/10) | Clear requirements, could add version numbers |\n| 10. Table of Contents | ❌ | MISSING (0/10) | Not present, GitHub provides partial substitute |\n\n**Overall Score**: 8.2/10 (82 out of 100 points)\n\n**Completion**: 9/10 required sections present (90%)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe README.md is a high-quality, comprehensive document that meets or exceeds professional open-source standards. It contains 9 out of 10 required sections, with only the Table of Contents missing. The document goes significantly beyond minimum requirements with extensive value proposition content, real-world examples, team workflow documentation, and comprehensive plugin descriptions.\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Professional marketing/positioning (value prop with metrics)\n- Complete installation workflow with team considerations\n- Real command examples with expected outcomes\n- Excellent visual hierarchy and readability\n- Multiple entry points for different user personas\n- Comprehensive documentation structure with appropriate linking\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Missing table of contents (only required item missing)\n- Environment variables delegated to separate files (minor)\n- Contributing guidelines minimal in main README (acceptable pattern)\n\n**Recommended Action**: Add table of contents. All other sections meet or exceed requirements.\n\n---\n\n```vote\nVERDICT: APPROVE\nCONFIDENCE: 9\nSUMMARY: README contains 9/10 required sections with excellent quality; only missing table of contents, which is mitigated by GitHub's auto-navigation.\nKEY_ISSUES: Missing table of contents (TOC) - recommended addition for 570-line document\n```\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8120,"cache_read_input_tokens":18743,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":8120,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":"toolu_016rExh5565oxHXccYcvpBvD","session_id":"234eec42-aa17-4e5d-bf0c-272b8dfdca63","uuid":"4190c0c9-1164-4d08-a09a-269c8bb5ab29"}

Installation Instructions\n**Status**: PRESENT - EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 66-75: Update instructions (for existing users)\n- Lines 78-101: Quick Start (3-step simplified installation)\n- Lines 295-406: Comprehensive \"Installation & Setup\" section\n  - Prerequisites (lines 298-312)\n  - Recommended setup approach (lines 315-382)\n  - Verification steps (lines 386-406)\n\n**Quality**: Excellent. Provides both quick-start (1 command) and detailed installation with verification steps. Clear separation of one-time setup vs per-project configuration.\n\n**Strength**: Includes team setup workflow (lines 350-357) showing how new team members get automatic setup.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 3. Usage/Quick Start\n**Status**: PRESENT - EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 78-101: Quick Start section (installation + activation)\n- Lines 409-459: Usage Guide section\n  - Quick start explanation (lines 411-420)\n  - Example: Full-cycle implementation (lines 422-434)\n  - Example: Import Figma design (lines 438-443)\n  - Link to comprehensive guide (lines 447-458)\n\n**Quality**: Excellent. Provides both minimal quick start and practical examples showing actual workflow value. Examples demonstrate real commands with expected outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 4. Plugin Listing\n**Status**: PRESENT - EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 104-293: \"What's Inside\" section with 5 plugin descriptions\n  - Frontend Development (lines 110-156): 46 lines of detailed features\n  - Code Analysis (lines 160-174): Core capabilities\n  - Bun Backend Development (lines 177-202): Tech stack + features\n  - Orchestration (lines 205-238): Skills-only plugin architecture\n  - Claudish CLI (lines 242-292): Multi-model CLI tool\n\n**Quality**: Excellent.

Configuration\n**Status**: PRESENT - GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 87-98: `.claude/settings.json` configuration format\n- Lines 302-309: Plugin manifest requirements and settings format\n- Lines 329-347: Per-project plugin enablement configuration\n- Lines 368-381: Multiple plugins configuration example\n\n**Quality**: Good. Shows exact JSON configuration format with examples. Explains the global marketplace + per-project plugin model.\n\n**Minor Gap**: Could include more advanced configuration options (if any exist), but covers all essential configuration needs.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 6. Environment Variables\n**Status**: PRESENT - GOOD\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Line 532 in plugin description: References DEPENDENCIES.md which documents environment variables\n- Indirect reference through MCP server setup requirements (Figma, Apidog tokens mentioned in plugin descriptions)\n\n**Quality**: Good. Environment variables are documented in linked files rather than inline in README.\n\n**Location**: According to CLAUDE.md context (from system reminder), environment variables are documented in:\n- `.env.example` (mentioned in CLAUDE.md, lines showing required/optional variables)\n- `plugins/frontend/DEPENDENCIES.md` (linked on line 532)\n\n**Assessment**: While not a dedicated section in README, environment variables are appropriately delegated to detailed documentation files. This is acceptable for a marketplace README where different plugins have different requirements.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 7. Contributing Guidelines\n**Status**: PRESENT - ADEQUATE\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 505-507: Community plugin requests process\n- Line 474: Link to `./docs/contributing.md` (dedicated contributing guide)\n\n**Quality**: Adequate. Contributing information exists but is minimal in the main README, delegated to dedicated file.\n\n**Content**:\n- Line 507: \"Have a plugin idea? [Open an issue](https://github.com/MadAppGang/claude-code/issues) with the `plugin-request` label\"\n- Line 474: Links to comprehensive contributing guide\n\n**Assessment**: Follows best practice of linking to detailed CONTRIBUTING.md rather than bloating README. Provides immediate entry point (issue with label) for casual contributors.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 8.

License information visible at top (badge) and detailed in dedicated section. Appropriately notes potential variations for individual plugins.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 9. Requirements/Prerequisites\n**STATUS**: PRESENT - EXCELLENT\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Lines 298-312: Dedicated \"Prerequisites\" section under Installation\n  - Claude Code Requirements (lines 299-309): Plugin system requirements, manifest location, settings format\n  - System Requirements (lines 311-312): Claude Code + Git\n\n**Quality**: Excellent. Clear separation of Claude Code plugin requirements vs general system requirements. Includes technical details about plugin format.\n\n**Additional Context**: Line 532 links to DEPENDENCIES.md for plugin-specific dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ 10. Table of Contents\n**STATUS**: MISSING\n\n**Evidence**: No table of contents present at the top of the README.\n\n**Impact**: MODERATE\n- README is 570 lines long\n- Contains multiple major sections\n- Navigation would significantly improve user experience\n- However, GitHub auto-generates navigation from headers (## sections)\n\n**Mitigating Factor**: GitHub's UI provides automatic navigation via header sidebar, partially compensating for missing TOC.\n\n**Assessment**: This is the only missing item from the checklist. While it would improve the document, GitHub's auto-generated navigation reduces the severity of this omission.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Strengths\n\nBeyond the required checklist, the README excels in several areas:\n\n1. **Value Proposition** (lines 8-63): Extensive positioning with quantified business impact\n2. **Update Instructions** (lines 66-75): Dedicated section for existing users\n3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Excellent use of emoji icons, badges, and markdown formatting\n4. **Multiple User Personas**: Content structured for end users, developers, and contributors\n5. **External Links**: Comprehensive documentation structure with links to detailed guides\n6. **Real Examples**: Actual command examples with expected outcomes (not hypothetical)\n7. **Team Workflow**: Explicit documentation of team setup and sync (lines 350-365)\n8. **Verification Steps**: Post-installation verification commands (lines 386-406)\n9. **Troubleshooting Links**: References to troubleshooting documentation\n10. **Community Support**: Multiple contact channels (email, issues, discussions) - lines 560-566\n\n---\n\n## Missing/Weak Areas\n\n### 1. Table of Contents (MISSING - Required Item)\n**Severity**: MODERATE\n**Recommendation**: Add TOC after badges section (after line 6)\n\n**Suggested Structure**:\n```markdown\n## Table of Contents\n- [Quick Start](#-quick-start)\n- [What's Inside](#-whats-inside)\n- [Installation & Setup](#-installation--setup)\n- [Usage Guide](#-usage-guide)\n- [Documentation](#-documentation)\n- [Roadmap](#-roadmap)\n- [License](#-license)\n- [Contact & Support](#-contact--support)\n```\n\n### 2. Environment Variables (WEAK - Delegated)\n**Severity**: MINOR\n**Current**: Documented in separate files (DEPENDENCIES.md, .env.example)\n**Recommendation**: Consider adding a brief \"Environment Variables\" section that lists common variables with links to detailed docs\n\n**Example**:\n```markdown\n## Environment Variables\n\nCommon environment variables (see [DEPENDENCIES.md](./plugins/frontend/DEPENDENCIES.md) for complete list):\n\n- `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Required for Figma integration\n- `APIDOG_API_TOKEN` - Required for API documentation sync\n- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Optional, for enhanced Git operations\n\nFor full configuration, see `.env.example` in the repository root.\n```\n\n### 3. Troubleshooting Section (WEAK - Only Linked)\n**Severity**: MINOR\n**Current**: Line 467 links to troubleshooting doc, line 402 mentions \"Common issues\" with link\n**Recommendation**: Add brief inline troubleshooting section with most common 2-3 issues, link to detailed guide for more\n\n---\n\n## Section Quality Scoring\n\n| Section | Status | Quality | Notes |\n|---------|--------|---------|-------|\n| 1.
