I'll launch the dev:researcher agent to search for the latest React Server Components patterns and create a comprehensive research report.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The dev:researcher agent supports PROXY_MODE, making it ideal for deep research tasks with external models
- Using ai-docs/ directory follows the project's documentation structure pattern for technical artifacts
- The agent will autonomously search, synthesize findings, and produce structured documentation
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Excellent! The research report has been successfully created. Let me show you what was produced:

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The dev:researcher agent autonomously conducted web searches, synthesized information from multiple authoritative sources, and produced a structured technical document
- The report includes both theoretical concepts and practical implementation patterns with code examples
- Positioning this in ai-docs/ follows the project's pattern for technical documentation that supports development work

## Report Summary

The comprehensive research report at **ai-docs/research-rsc.md** covers React Server Components patterns as of 2026:

### Key Findings:

1. **Paradigm Shift**: Server Components are now the default in modern React - client components require explicit opt-in with `"use client"`

2. **Major Features in 2026**:
   - **Partial Prerendering (PPR)** - Stable and production-ready for mixing static/dynamic content
   - **Server Actions** - Have largely replaced traditional API routes
   - **Automatic Request Deduplication** - Framework-level optimization for parallel data fetching

3. **Critical Patterns Documented**:
   - Data fetching colocation (fetch directly in components)
   - Waterfall prevention through parallel requests
   - Streaming with Suspense for progressive rendering
   - URL-as-state pattern for shareable UI state
   - Granular caching strategies

4. **Real-World Guidance**:
   - Next.js App Router implementation patterns
   - Migration strategies from Client Components
   - Common pitfalls and their solutions
   - Testing approaches for Server Components

The report includes **50+ code examples** comparing correct patterns with anti-patterns, making it immediately actionable for development teams. It synthesizes information from official React docs, Next.js documentation, and the latest 2026 best practices from the React community.

The document is ready to use as a team reference guide or onboarding resource for React Server Components development!
