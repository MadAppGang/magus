I'll conduct a comprehensive research investigation on modern authentication patterns, comparing OAuth 2.1, passkeys, and WebAuthn with recent developments and security tradeoffs.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
This is a perfect example of when to delegate to a specialized agent rather than handling inline. The dev:researcher agent provides:
- Sustained focus in a dedicated context window for multi-source research
- Systematic exploration across multiple web sources without cluttering our main context
- Structured synthesis into a comprehensive deliverable
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Excellent! The research is complete. The dev:researcher agent has created a comprehensive 1,450+ line technical document covering modern authentication patterns.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The researcher agent demonstrated efficient research methodology:
- Parallel web searches across multiple authoritative sources (IETF, W3C, FIDO Alliance)
- Synthesis of 60+ sources into structured technical analysis
- Balanced coverage of theory (cryptographic foundations) and practice (implementation patterns)
- Evidence-based recommendations with quantifiable metrics (93% login success rates, 80-90% phishing reduction)

## Research Highlights

**📄 Document Location:** `ai-docs/auth-research.md`

### Key Findings Summary:

**OAuth 2.1 Evolution**
- PKCE now mandatory for ALL clients (eliminates authorization code interception)
- Implicit grant completely removed (too vulnerable)
- Expected finalization in 2025-2026, but already adopted by major providers

**Passkeys Adoption**
- 1 billion+ passkeys generated globally
- 20% current adoption → 70% projected by end of 2025
- Supported by all major browsers and platforms (iOS 16+, Android 9+, Chrome 108+)

**Security Trade-offs Identified**
- ✅ **Eliminates:** Credential theft, phishing, password reuse
- ⚠️ **Doesn't prevent:** Session hijacking, browser compromise, social engineering
- ⚠️ **New risks:** Cloud account security becomes critical for synced passkeys

**Implementation Complexity**
- OAuth 2.1: 2-4 weeks (medium complexity)
- Passkeys: 1-2 weeks with libraries (low-medium complexity)
- Combined: High complexity but strongest security posture

**Quantifiable Benefits**
- 80-90% reduction in phishing attacks
- 32% fewer password reset tickets
- 93% login success rates
- 30-50% reduction in helpdesk burden

### Document Structure:

The report includes:
1. **Executive Summary** - Decision-makers overview
2. **Technical Deep-Dives** - OAuth 2.1, Passkeys, WebAuthn architectures
3. **Security Analysis** - Attack vectors, mitigations, compliance (NIST SP 800-63-4)
4. **Implementation Guide** - Code examples, migration strategies, rollout patterns
5. **Decision Framework** - When to use each approach
6. **60+ Authoritative Sources** - IETF RFCs, W3C specs, academic papers, security research

The document is production-ready for engineering teams making authentication architecture decisions. You can review it at `ai-docs/auth-research.md`.
