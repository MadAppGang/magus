This kills all Claude CLI sessions running on the machine. Instead, ask the user to restart applications manually or close specific windows.\n\n## Project Overview\n\n**Repository:** MAG Claude Plugins\n**Purpose:** Professional plugin marketplace for Claude Code\n**Owner:** Jack Rudenko (i@madappgang.com) @ MadAppGang\n**License:** MIT\n\n## Plugins\n\n| Plugin | Version | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|---------|\n| **Frontend** | v3.13.0 | React/TypeScript dev with 11 agents, multi-model review |\n| **Code Analysis** | v3.0.0 | Codebase investigation with claudemem, enrichment mode (non-blocking) |\n| **Bun Backend** | v1.5.2 | TypeScript backend with Bun, Apidog integration |\n| **Orchestration** | v0.8.2 | Multi-agent coordination patterns (6 skills) |\n| **Agent Development** | v1.3.0 | Create Claude Code agents, PROXY_MODE error handling |\n| **SEO** | v1.5.1 | SEO analysis and optimization with AUTO GATEs |\n| **Video Editing** | v1.0.1 | FFmpeg, Whisper, Final Cut Pro integration |\n| **Nanobanana** | v2.2.3 | AI image generation with Gemini 3 Pro Image |\n| **Dev** | v1.26.0 | Universal dev assistant with real validation loops, 44 skills |\n\n**Claudish CLI**: `npm install -g claudish` - Run Claude with OpenRouter models (separate repo)\n\n## Key Architecture Decisions\n\n### 1. Team-First Configuration\n\n**Shareable** (committed to git):\n- Project IDs, URLs, configuration\n- `.claude/settings.json` with project config\n- No secrets\n\n**Private** (environment variables):\n- API tokens, credentials\n- Each developer's `.env` file\n- Never committed\n\n### 2. Smart Validation\n\nConfiguration commands check existing setup before asking questions, validate credentials before saving.\n\n### 3. Project-Specific Installation\n\nPlugins can be installed:\n- Globally (all projects)\n- Per-project (`.claude/settings.json`)\n- Teams use project-specific for consistency\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nclaude-code/\n├── README.md                  # Main documentation\n├── CLAUDE.md                  # This file\n├── .env.example              # Environment template\n├── LICENSE                   # MIT\n├── .gitignore               # Excludes secrets\n├── RELEASE_PROCESS.md        # Plugin release process guide\n├── docs/                    # User documentation\n│   ├── frontend-development.md\n│   └── local-development.md\n├── ai-docs/                 # Technical documentation\n│   ├── TEAM_CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md\n│   ├── DYNAMIC_MCP_GUIDE.md\n│   ├── IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md\n│   ├── COMPLETE_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md\n│   └── FINAL_SUMMARY.md\n├── skills/                  # Project-level skills\n│   └── release/             # Plugin release process skill\n│       └── SKILL.md\n├── .claude-plugin/\n│   └── marketplace.json\n└── plugins/\n    ├── multimodel/                   # Multi-model collaboration and orchestration\n    │   ├── plugin.json\n    │   ├── commands/                (team command)\n    │   └── skills/                  (14 skills)\n    ├── frontend/                     # Full-featured frontend plugin\n    │   ├── plugin.json\n    │   ├── DEPENDENCIES.md\n    │   ├── README.md\n    │   ├── agents/                   (11 agents)\n    │   ├── commands/                 (7 commands)\n    │   ├── skills/                   (11 skills)\n    │   └── mcp-servers/\n    ├── code-analysis/                # Code analysis plugin\n    │   ├── plugin.json\n    │   ├── agents/                   (1 agent)\n    │   ├── commands/                 (1 command)\n    │   └── skills/                   (2 skills)\n    └── bun/                          # Backend plugin\n        ├── plugin.json\n        ├── README.md\n        ├── agents/                   (3 agents)\n        ├── commands/                 (3 commands)\n        ├── skills/                   (1 skill)\n        └── mcp-servers/\n```\n\n## Important Files\n\n### For Users\n- `README.md` -

{"type":"assistant","message":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","id":"msg_01LNQ4Td3igUQcy42uaR5G6T","type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Excellent! The caching layer implementation is complete. Let me provide you with educational insights about what was accomplished and the key design decisions made.\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**1. LRU Cache Design Pattern**: The implementation uses a Map + Array hybrid approach for O(1) lookups and efficient access tracking. Each cache access updates the entry's position in the access order array, ensuring the least recently used items are evicted first when the cache reaches capacity.\n\n**2. Namespace Pattern for Cache Organization**: Rather than a flat cache, the system uses `NamespacedCacheManager` to logically group related data (e.g., `marketplace:*`, `user:*`, `plugin:*`). This enables targeted invalidation - when a marketplace refreshes, only that namespace gets cleared, preserving other cached data.\n\n**3. Observer Pattern for Invalidation Hooks**: The cache invalidation system uses hooks that trigger on specific events (plugin install/remove, settings changes). This decouples the cache from the plugin manager - the manager just fires events, and registered hooks decide what to invalidate. This is extensible and prevents tight coupling.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nThe dev:developer agent successfully implemented a **production-ready caching layer** with the following components:\n\n### Core Files Created\n\n1. **`cache-manager.ts`** (494 lines)\n   - `CacheManager<T>` - Generic LRU cache with TTL support\n   - `NamespacedCacheManager<T>` - Organized cache with namespace isolation\n   - Statistics tracking (hits, misses, evictions, expirations)\n   - Pattern-based invalidation with wildcard support\n\n2. **`cache-hooks.ts`** (374 lines)\n   - `CacheInvalidationHooks` - Event-driven invalidation system\n   - `PluginCacheInvalidator` - Scoped invalidator utility\n   - Standard hooks for plugin lifecycle events\n   - Custom invalidation rules with conditions\n\n3. **Comprehensive Tests** (919 lines total)\n   - **Unit tests**: 42 tests covering all cache operations\n   - **Integration tests**: 23 tests for real-world scenarios\n   - **Coverage**: LRU eviction, TTL expiration, hooks, edge cases\n\n### Key Features\n\n✅ **LRU Eviction** - Automatic removal of least recently used entries when cache is full  \n✅ **TTL Support** - Global and per-entry time-to-live with automatic expiration  \n✅ **Thread-Safe** - Synchronous operations prevent race conditions  \n✅ **Invalidation Hooks** - Event-driven cache clearing on plugin changes  \n✅ **Pattern Matching** - Wildcard support for flexible invalidation (`user:*`, `*:123`)  \n✅ **Statistics** - Hit rate, miss rate, eviction count, expiration count tracking  \n\n### Integration Points\n\nThe cache is fully integrated into the plugin system:\n- **Plugin Manager** uses `NamespacedCacheManager` for all plugin data caching\n- **Automatic invalidation** on plugin install/remove/enable/disable\n- **Public API** exports cache managers, hooks, and statistics\n- **500 entry limit** with 5-minute TTL by default\n\n### Test Results\n\n**✅ All 327 tests passing** (65 new cache tests + 262 existing)  \n**✅ Zero linting errors**  \n**✅ Full TypeScript type safety**  \n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Architecture Highlight - Separation of Concerns**: Notice how the cache system is completely independent of the plugin manager. The `CacheManager` has zero knowledge of plugins - it's a generic caching utility. The `cache-hooks.ts` module provides the glue layer that connects plugin events to cache invalidation. This makes the cache reusable for other parts of the system.\n\n**Performance Optimization - Fire-and-Forget Hooks**: The invalidation hooks use `Promise.allSettled()` to run async operations without blocking. Even if a hook fails or takes time, cache operations continue normally. This prevents cache slowdowns from propagating to the plugin system.\n\n**Testing Strategy - Unit + Integration Coverage**: The test suite uses both unit tests (testing cache behavior in isolation) and integration tests (testing real plugin workflows).

Let me provide you with educational insights about what was accomplished and the key design decisions made.\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**1. LRU Cache Design Pattern**: The implementation uses a Map + Array hybrid approach for O(1) lookups and efficient access tracking. Each cache access updates the entry's position in the access order array, ensuring the least recently used items are evicted first when the cache reaches capacity.\n\n**2. Namespace Pattern for Cache Organization**: Rather than a flat cache, the system uses `NamespacedCacheManager` to logically group related data (e.g., `marketplace:*`, `user:*`, `plugin:*`). This enables targeted invalidation - when a marketplace refreshes, only that namespace gets cleared, preserving other cached data.\n\n**3. Observer Pattern for Invalidation Hooks**: The cache invalidation system uses hooks that trigger on specific events (plugin install/remove, settings changes). This decouples the cache from the plugin manager - the manager just fires events, and registered hooks decide what to invalidate. This is extensible and prevents tight coupling.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\n## Implementation Summary\n\nThe dev:developer agent successfully implemented a **production-ready caching layer** with the following components:\n\n### Core Files Created\n\n1. **`cache-manager.ts`** (494 lines)\n   - `CacheManager<T>` - Generic LRU cache with TTL support\n   - `NamespacedCacheManager<T>` - Organized cache with namespace isolation\n   - Statistics tracking (hits, misses, evictions, expirations)\n   - Pattern-based invalidation with wildcard support\n\n2. **`cache-hooks.ts`** (374 lines)\n   - `CacheInvalidationHooks` - Event-driven invalidation system\n   - `PluginCacheInvalidator` - Scoped invalidator utility\n   - Standard hooks for plugin lifecycle events\n   - Custom invalidation rules with conditions\n\n3. **Comprehensive Tests** (919 lines total)\n   - **Unit tests**: 42 tests covering all cache operations\n   - **Integration tests**: 23 tests for real-world scenarios\n   - **Coverage**: LRU eviction, TTL expiration, hooks, edge cases\n\n### Key Features\n\n✅ **LRU Eviction** - Automatic removal of least recently used entries when cache is full  \n✅ **TTL Support** - Global and per-entry time-to-live with automatic expiration  \n✅ **Thread-Safe** - Synchronous operations prevent race conditions  \n✅ **Invalidation Hooks** - Event-driven cache clearing on plugin changes  \n✅ **Pattern Matching** - Wildcard support for flexible invalidation (`user:*`, `*:123`)  \n✅ **Statistics** - Hit rate, miss rate, eviction count, expiration count tracking  \n\n### Integration Points\n\nThe cache is fully integrated into the plugin system:\n- **Plugin Manager** uses `NamespacedCacheManager` for all plugin data caching\n- **Automatic invalidation** on plugin install/remove/enable/disable\n- **Public API** exports cache managers, hooks, and statistics\n- **500 entry limit** with 5-minute TTL by default\n\n### Test Results\n\n**✅ All 327 tests passing** (65 new cache tests + 262 existing)  \n**✅ Zero linting errors**  \n**✅ Full TypeScript type safety**  \n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Architecture Highlight - Separation of Concerns**: Notice how the cache system is completely independent of the plugin manager. The `CacheManager` has zero knowledge of plugins - it's a generic caching utility. The `cache-hooks.ts` module provides the glue layer that connects plugin events to cache invalidation. This makes the cache reusable for other parts of the system.\n\n**Performance Optimization - Fire-and-Forget Hooks**: The invalidation hooks use `Promise.allSettled()` to run async operations without blocking. Even if a hook fails or takes time, cache operations continue normally. This prevents cache slowdowns from propagating to the plugin system.\n\n**Testing Strategy - Unit + Integration Coverage**: The test suite uses both unit tests (testing cache behavior in isolation) and integration tests (testing real plugin workflows). This catches both logic bugs and integration issues, ensuring the system works correctly in production scenarios.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nThe implementation is **production-ready** and follows best practices for caching systems. You can now use the cache manager throughout the plugin system to improve performance and reduce redundant operations.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"e5405671-48d9-43e6-86af-65b9547991a8","total_cost_usd":1.2395155,"usage":{"input_tokens":17,"cache_creation_input_tokens":49020,"cache_read_input_tokens":197932,"output_tokens":1855,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":49020}},"modelUsage":{"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":87,"outputTokens":6097,"cacheReadInputTokens":806894,"cacheCreationInputTokens":106802,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.2238194999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":13891,"outputTokens":361,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.015695999999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"b49303bf-140d-4b62-be15-a49eba9e1271"}
