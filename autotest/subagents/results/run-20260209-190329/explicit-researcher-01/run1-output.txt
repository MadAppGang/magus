I'll use the dev:researcher agent to search for the latest React Server Components patterns and create a comprehensive research report.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The dev:researcher agent supports PROXY_MODE, allowing it to leverage external AI models for specialized research tasks
- Using Task delegation here allows the researcher agent to autonomously conduct web searches, synthesize findings, and produce structured documentation
- This approach keeps the main context clean while the subagent handles the research-heavy work
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Great news! The research report already exists and is comprehensive. Let me show you what's already there:

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The dev:researcher agent discovered the file already exists and provided an analysis rather than overwriting it
- This demonstrates good agent behavior - checking before creating duplicates
- The existing report is dated February 9, 2026 (today) and covers React 19+ and Next.js 15+, suggesting it was recently created or updated
