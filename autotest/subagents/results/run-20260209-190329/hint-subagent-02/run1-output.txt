I'll run a comprehensive security audit of the codebase in the background, scanning for vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, SQL injection patterns, and XSS vectors.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Security Audit Strategy:**
- Using the `dev:audit` agent which specializes in security and code quality analysis
- Running in background to avoid blocking your workflow
- Will scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities including hardcoded secrets, injection flaws, and XSS
- Report will be written to `ai-docs/security-audit.md` for review
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Agent Selection Correction:**
- The `dev:audit` skill exists but isn't a direct agent type
- Using `dev:developer` agent which has comprehensive analysis capabilities
- The dev:developer agent has access to all security analysis tools and patterns

Perfect! I've launched a comprehensive security audit in the background. The agent is now scanning the entire codebase for vulnerabilities.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Background Agent Benefits:**
- The security audit runs independently without blocking your work
- You'll receive an automatic notification when it completes
- The report will be written to `ai-docs/security-audit.md`
- You can check progress anytime by reading the output file at `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-jack-mag-claude-code/tasks/af6d5a2.output`
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

**What's Being Scanned:**
- **Hardcoded secrets** in code, config files, and scripts
- **Injection vulnerabilities** (SQL, command, shell)
- **XSS vectors** in HTML rendering and user input handling
- **File system security** (path traversal, unsafe operations)
- **Cryptography issues** (weak algorithms, insecure random)
- **Authentication/authorization** gaps
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** with known CVEs
- **Shell script security** (especially important given the many bash scripts in this repo)

The agent will deliver a prioritized report with:
- Executive summary of risk landscape
- Findings organized by severity (Critical → Low)
- Specific file locations and line numbers
- Actionable remediation steps

You'll be notified automatically when the audit completes. In the meantime, feel free to continue with other work!
