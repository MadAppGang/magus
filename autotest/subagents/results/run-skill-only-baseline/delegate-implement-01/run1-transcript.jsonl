I've completed the comprehensive caching layer implementation. Let me provide you with a detailed summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## ✅ Complete Caching Layer Implementation\n\nThe caching system has been **fully implemented and tested**. Here's what's in place:\n\n### 🎯 Core Components\n\n**1. CacheManager Class** (`cache-manager.ts`)\n- **LRU Eviction Strategy**: Automatically removes least recently used entries when cache reaches capacity\n- **TTL Support**: Optional time-to-live for automatic expiration\n- **Pattern-based Invalidation**: Support for wildcard patterns (`user:*`, `*:123`)\n- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics including hit rate, eviction count, expiration count\n- **Invalidation Hooks**: Extensible hook system for custom invalidation logic\n- **Namespace Support**: `NamespacedCacheManager` for logical grouping (e.g., `plugins`, `marketplace`, `settings`)\n\n**2. Cache Invalidation Hooks** (`cache-hooks.ts`)\n- **Event-driven Architecture**: Automatic cache invalidation based on system events\n- **Standard Hooks**: Pre-configured for plugin install/uninstall, settings changes, marketplace refresh\n- **Custom Rules**: Support for conditional invalidation and custom patterns\n- **Plugin-specific Invalidator**: High-level API for plugin cache management\n\n**3.
