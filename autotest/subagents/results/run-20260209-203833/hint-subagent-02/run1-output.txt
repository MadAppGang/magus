I'll launch a security audit subagent to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities. This is a complex analysis task that's perfect for delegation.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- Security audits benefit from dedicated context windows to maintain comprehensive analysis across many files
- Running in background allows continued work while the audit completes
- The `dev:audit` agent specializes in security scanning with patterns for common vulnerabilities
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
I see - the `dev:audit` skill exists but there's no dedicated audit agent. Let me use the appropriate agent for this task. The `code-analysis:detective` agent is perfect for comprehensive codebase investigation.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The detective agent specializes in deep codebase analysis and pattern detection
- It has access to semantic search tools (claudemem) for finding patterns across many files
- Background execution allows thorough scanning without blocking your work
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Perfect! I've launched a security audit subagent that's now scanning the entire codebase in the background.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Background agents run independently**: The detective agent is now analyzing the codebase without blocking your current session
- **Automatic notification**: You'll receive an alert when the audit completes
- **Progress monitoring**: You can check intermediate progress by reading the output file at any time
- **Comprehensive scanning**: The agent will use Grep to search for security patterns across all files, then analyze and categorize findings by severity
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

The security audit is running and will:

1. **Search for hardcoded secrets** - API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys
2. **Detect injection vulnerabilities** - SQL injection, command injection, XSS vectors
3. **Analyze authentication/authorization** - Missing checks, weak policies, JWT issues
4. **Check dependencies** - Known vulnerabilities in package.json files
5. **Review configurations** - Debug modes, CORS settings, security headers
6. **Examine cryptography** - Weak algorithms, hardcoded keys
7. **Assess file operations** - Path traversal, unsafe file handling

The final report will be written to **`ai-docs/security-audit.md`** with:
- Executive summary with risk assessment
- Findings categorized by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Specific file locations and line numbers
- Impact analysis and remediation recommendations

You'll be notified automatically when the audit completes. Feel free to continue with other tasks while it runs!
