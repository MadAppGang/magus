I'll launch a specialized agent to comprehensively review all agent definitions across the repository and generate a quality report on their description effectiveness.
Excellent! The comprehensive agent quality review is complete. Let me show you the key findings:

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The agentdev:reviewer agent specializes in evaluating agent descriptions against proven delegation patterns
- This leverages the repository's own learnings about what makes agents discoverable (examples, specialized claims, clear triggers)
- The review analyzed 51 agents across 10 plugins using objective criteria from months of validation testing
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

## 📊 Quality Overview

Out of **51 total agents** across 10 plugins:

- **🏆 Excellent (16%)**: 8 agents - detective, researcher, developer, api-architect
- **✅ Good (29%)**: 15 agents 
- **⚠️ Needs Improvement (39%)**: 20 agents
- **❌ Poor (16%)**: 8 agents

## 🎯 Critical Findings

### World-Class Templates (Learn from These)

1. **code-analysis/detective** (10/10) - Perfect example with:
   - AST analysis capability claims
   - Comprehensive anti-patterns section
   - Multiple user→assistant→commentary examples
   
2. **dev/researcher** (9.5/10) - Enhanced with "IMPORTANT" directives
3. **bun/api-architect** (9/10) - Excellent multi-example structure

### Critical Issues

1. **3 agents have NO description at all**:
   - frontend/tester
   - frontend/cleaner
   - frontend/api-analyst

2. **video-editing plugin** (2.3/10 avg) - All 3 agents need complete rewrites

3. **45% lack examples** - Critical for teaching delegation patterns

4. **Name collision**: `agentdev/developer` vs `dev:developer` causes confusion

## 📈 Plugin Rankings

| Rank | Plugin | Agents | Avg Score | Status |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 🏆 1 | code-analysis | 1 | 10.0/10 | Perfect template |
| 🥈 2 | bun | 3 | 8.3/10 | Consistent excellence |
| 🥉 3 | agentdev | 3 | 7.3/10 | Good overall |
| 4 | dev | 17 | 6.8/10 | Mixed (10→5/10) |
| 10 | video-editing | 3 | 2.3/10 | Needs rewrites |

## 🔧 Immediate Actions Required

**Priority 1 (Blocking):**
- Add descriptions to 3 frontend agents (tester, cleaner, api-analyst)
- Rename/differentiate agentdev/developer from dev:developer
- Rewrite all video-editing agents

**Priority 2 (High Impact):**
- Add examples to 6 dev/doc-* agents
- Add examples to 5 seo/* agents
- Clarify SEO agent role differentiation

**Priority 3 (Consistency):**
- Add PROXY_MODE support to 31 agents (61% missing)
- Add anti-patterns to 43 agents (84% missing)
- Add "Use this agent when..." to all agents

## 📄 Full Report

The complete analysis is saved here:
**`ai-docs/agent-quality-report-20260209-213102.md`**

It includes:
- Detailed agent-by-agent assessment table
- Best practices with code examples
- Common weaknesses patterns
- Implementation templates
- 12-week improvement timeline

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The quality gap between top (detective: 10/10) and bottom (video-editing: 2.3/10) agents is massive
- Best practices are already proven in the repo (see code-analysis/detective) - just need propagation
- The 45% missing examples explains why implicit delegation fails - LLMs learn from examples, not descriptions

Would you like me to start implementing fixes for the Priority 1 critical issues, or would you prefer to review the full report first?
