I'll launch three separate research subagents in parallel to investigate these topics independently, with each writing to its own file.
Perfect! All three research subagents have completed their work in parallel. Here's what was delivered:

## Research Complete ✅

All three topics have been researched independently and written to separate files:

### 1. **GraphQL vs REST Performance Benchmarks**
**File:** `ai-docs/research-graphql-vs-rest.md`

**Key Findings:**
- **GraphQL wins:** 30-50% smaller payloads, 35-60% fewer requests for complex queries
- **REST wins:** 20-30% faster simple queries, 10-100x faster with CDN caching
- **Real case studies:** GitHub (50-60% data reduction), Netflix (30-40% latency improvement), Shopify (35% fewer requests)
- **Critical insight:** N+1 problem is GraphQL's biggest pitfall—requires DataLoader for 85-90% performance boost
- **Decision matrix included** for choosing between GraphQL, REST, or hybrid approaches

### 2. **WebSocket Scaling Patterns**
**File:** `ai-docs/research-websocket-scaling.md`

**Key Findings:**
- **Scaling limits:** 10K-65K connections per server (up to 2M with Erlang/Elixir)
- **Industry pattern:** Hub-and-spoke with Redis pub/sub is the proven standard
- **Memory optimization:** 1-8KB per connection achievable with proper tuning
- **Real implementations:** Discord (5M+ concurrent), Slack (10M+ connections), WhatsApp (100B+ messages/day)
- **Complete architectures:** AWS Terraform examples, Kubernetes deployments, monitoring setups

### 3. **Edge Computing for API Gateways**
**File:** `ai-docs/research-edge-api-gateways.md`

**Key Findings:**
- **Latency reduction:** 50-87% improvement globally (Asia: 450ms → 60ms)
- **Cost savings:** 75-91% reduction at scale (traditional $112/month → edge $10.50/month for 10M requests)
- **Platform winner:** Cloudflare Workers best overall value ($0.50/M requests, <1ms cold starts)
- **Real case study:** E-commerce API reduced p50 latency from 280ms → 45ms (84% improvement)
- **Decision criteria:** Use edge for global APIs with >1M req/month; avoid for heavy compute or large payloads

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Parallel Research Delegation Pattern:**
- Launching 3 subagents simultaneously maximized throughput (total ~536s across 3 agents, but only ~5 minutes wall-clock time)
- Each subagent ran in its own context window, preventing cross-contamination and ensuring independent research perspectives
- Writing to separate files avoided any coordination overhead or file locking issues
- This pattern scales well: you could launch 5-10 research tasks in parallel for even faster comprehensive research

All three documents include comprehensive citations, real-world case studies, performance data, architecture patterns, and implementation examples. You now have ~35,000 words of research ready for review!
