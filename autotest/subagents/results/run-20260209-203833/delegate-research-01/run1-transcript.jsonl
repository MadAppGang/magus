The convergence of **OAuth 2.1** eliminating insecure flows, **passkeys** reaching critical adoption mass, and **WebAuthn** providing robust cryptographic foundations creates an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate password-based attacks.\n  1355→\n  1356→**Key Takeaways:**\n  1357→\n  1358→1. **OAuth 2.1** is production-ready and should be adopted immediately for any OAuth implementation, with mandatory PKCE providing strong authorization code protection.\n  1359→\n  1360→2. **Passkeys** have crossed the chasm from early adopter to mainstream adoption, with major platforms, mature libraries, and clear implementation patterns making them practical for enterprise deployment.\n  1361→\n  1362→3. **Security tradeoffs** are well-understood: passkeys eliminate credential theft and phishing but do not prevent session hijacking, requiring complementary controls like continuous authentication and token rotation.\n  1363→\n  1364→4. **Enterprise adoption** is accelerating due to operational efficiency gains (30-50% helpdesk burden reduction), regulatory compliance requirements (NIST SP 800-63-4), and user experience improvements (93% login success rates).\n  1365→\n  1366→5. **Hybrid architectures** combining OAuth 2.1 for authorization with passkeys for authentication provide the strongest security posture for modern applications in 2026.\n  1367→\n  1368→The authentication landscape will continue evolving rapidly, but the direction is clear: **phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication is becoming the baseline expectation** for secure systems. Organizations that delay adoption risk both security incidents and competitive disadvantage as users increasingly expect seamless, secure authentication experiences.\n  1369→\n  1370→---\n  1371→\n
