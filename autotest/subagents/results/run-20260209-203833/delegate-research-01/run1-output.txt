I'll conduct a comprehensive research on modern authentication patterns using the dev:researcher agent, which is specialized for deep research with web search capabilities.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- This task requires extensive web research across multiple sources, making it perfect for the dev:researcher agent which has dedicated research capabilities
- The agent will conduct parallel exploration across different authentication approaches and synthesize findings into a cohesive report
- Delegating to a specialized agent keeps the main context clean while the research agent focuses entirely on gathering and analyzing information
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Excellent news! The research is already complete. The dev:researcher agent found that `ai-docs/auth-research.md` already contains a comprehensive 1,452-line deep-dive report on modern authentication patterns.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The existing document demonstrates the value of checking before creating - it saved significant research time
- The agent verified the document's comprehensiveness by analyzing its structure, sources, and coverage of requested topics
- This pattern of "check existing work first" is a key principle in the codebase (see CLAUDE.md's "Validation First" design principle)

## What's Already in the Report

The existing research document covers all your requested topics:

### Core Authentication Patterns
- **OAuth 2.1**: Security improvements, PKCE requirements, removal of insecure grants, adoption timeline
- **Passkeys & WebAuthn**: Adoption statistics, implementation best practices, browser support, security configuration  
- **Cryptographic Foundations**: Public key cryptography, FIDO2 protocols, attestation security model

### Analysis & Guidance
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Session hijacking, browser attacks, cloud account takeover, downgrade attacks, recovery vulnerabilities
- **Enterprise Implementation**: Deployment strategies, SSO integration, device management
- **Comparative Analysis**: Decision framework with risk assessment matrix
- **2026 Outlook**: Future trends, regulatory landscape, adoption timeline

### Supporting Materials
- **73 authoritative sources** (IETF RFCs, W3C specs, FIDO Alliance, major tech companies)
- **Code examples** in TypeScript/Node.js for OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and WebAuthn
- **Decision matrices** for selecting authentication approaches
- **Recent developments** from 2024-2026 including OAuth 2.1 draft status, WebAuthn Level 3

The document is ready to use as-is. Would you like me to:
1. **Update** a specific section with more recent information?
2. **Expand** coverage of a particular authentication pattern?
3. **Add** analysis of a different aspect (e.g., mobile implementation, specific frameworks)?
4. **Create** a summary/executive version for quick reference?
