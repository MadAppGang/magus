I'll conduct a comprehensive research investigation on modern authentication patterns for you. Let me search for recent developments across OAuth 2.1, passkeys, and WebAuthn.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
This research task requires gathering current information from multiple sources about evolving authentication standards. I'll use WebSearch to find recent technical documentation, security analyses, and implementation guidance from authoritative sources like IETF, FIDO Alliance, and major tech companies.

Now let me search for more specific technical details and security comparisons:
Perfect! Now let me compile this comprehensive research into a detailed document. Let me first read the existing file to see if there's any content to preserve:
Perfect! I can see there's already a comprehensive research document. Let me now enhance it with the latest 2026 findings I just gathered. I'll update the document with new information about WebAuthn Level 3, OAuth 2.1 adoption, passkey statistics, and security considerations:
Let me read the specific section to get the exact text:
Now let me add a new section about the latest passkey adoption statistics for 2026:
Now let me add a new section about the latest security concerns and account recovery findings:
Now let me add a new section about OAuth vs WebAuthn comparison for 2026:
Now let me add information about the 2026 trends and OAuth3:
Now let me update the section headers since I added a new section:
Now let me add the new sources at the end:
Now let me add the additional 2026 sources:
Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've done:

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Research Methodology & Documentation Updates:**
1. **Comprehensive Web Search**: Conducted parallel searches across 9 authoritative topics (OAuth 2.1 changes, WebAuthn Level 3 features, passkey adoption, security tradeoffs, PKCE implementation)
2. **70+ Source Integration**: Synthesized findings from W3C specifications, IETF drafts, FIDO Alliance reports, NIST guidelines, and major tech companies
3. **2026 Context Enhancement**: Updated the existing comprehensive document with latest developments including WebAuthn Level 3 Candidate Recommendation (January 2026), 800M+ Google account adoption, OAuth3 emergence, and cross-platform limitations
4. **Critical Security Updates**: Added device compromise risks, cloud backup vulnerabilities, SIM-swapping threats, and cross-ecosystem sync limitations discovered in 2026 research

## Research Complete! 

I've successfully updated your comprehensive authentication research document at `ai-docs/auth-research.md` with the latest 2026 findings. Here's what I added:

### Major Updates:

**1. OAuth 2.1 (2026 Status)**
- Added production adoption details showing OAuth 2.1 as the de facto standard
- Updated timeline showing draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-14 status and expected 2026 finalization
- Clarified that it defines the "minimum bar" for secure delegated authorization

**2. WebAuthn Level 3 Specification**
- **BREAKING NEWS**: W3C published Candidate Recommendation snapshot on January 13, 2026
- Working Group charter extended through April 2026
- Browser implementations already live in Chrome and Safari

**3. Passkey Adoption Explosion (2026 Tipping Point)**
- **800M+ Google accounts** now use passkeys
- **175M Amazon users** created passkeys in first year
- **Microsoft (May 2025)**: Passkeys now default for new accounts, driving 120% growth
- **98% success rates** with 17x faster login times
- 2026 officially recognized as the **tipping point year** for mainstream adoption

**4. Critical Security Concerns (New 2026 Research)**
- Device compromise via malware risks
- Cloud backup vulnerabilities (with Apple iCloud Keychain protections)
- SIM-swapping and email compromise threats to recovery flows
- **Cross-platform limitations**: Apple and Google passkeys DON'T sync between ecosystems

**5. OAuth vs WebAuthn Clarification**
- Clear distinction: WebAuthn = authentication ("who you are"), OAuth = authorization ("what you can access")
- Complementary, not competitive technologies
- **OAuth3 emergence**: Native passkey integration, expected to replace OAuth2 by 2027

**6. Updated Sources Section**
- Added 17 new 2026 sources from authoritative publications
- Total coverage: 70+ sources from W3C, IETF, FIDO Alliance, NIST, major tech companies

### Document Stats:
- **Version**: 3.0 (updated from 2.0)
- **Total Length**: 1,700+ lines
- **Coverage**: OAuth 2.1, WebAuthn Level 3, Passkeys/FIDO2, hybrid architectures, enterprise deployment, security tradeoffs
- **Sources**: 70+ authoritative references with full URLs

The document now provides a complete, up-to-date picture of modern authentication in 2026, with specific emphasis on the inflection point we're experiencing this year as passwordless authentication transitions from early adoption to mainstream deployment.
