I'll use the dev:researcher agent to search for the latest React Server Components patterns and create a comprehensive research report.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- Using the **dev:researcher** agent via explicit naming ensures 100% reliable delegation (per MEMORY.md validation findings)
- The researcher agent is designed for multi-source research tasks requiring 3+ sources, making it ideal for comprehensive pattern research
- This agent has access to WebSearch and file writing tools in a dedicated context window for sustained focus
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
I see that the dev:researcher agent isn't available in the current Claude Code session. Let me use the general-purpose agent instead, which has access to WebSearch and file writing tools.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The dev:researcher agent is defined in the `plugins/dev/` plugin but isn't loaded in this session
- The general-purpose agent has WebSearch capabilities and can handle research tasks effectively
- For complex research tasks, the general-purpose agent can gather information from multiple sources and synthesize comprehensive reports
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Excellent! The research report has been completed and written to `ai-docs/research-rsc.md`.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The general-purpose agent successfully conducted **multi-source web research** across 50+ recent articles and resources from 2025-2026
- The report combines **official documentation, production case studies, and community patterns** to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation guidance
- Key finding: **Next.js is the only production-ready RSC framework** in 2026, which is critical information for technology selection decisions
