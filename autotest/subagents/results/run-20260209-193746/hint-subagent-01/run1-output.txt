I'll launch a specialized subagent to comprehensively review all agent definitions across the repository and generate a quality report.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- Using the **agentdev:reviewer** agent which specializes in agent quality assessment
- This task requires analyzing multiple agent files across different plugins - perfect for a dedicated subagent with sustained focus
- The reviewer agent has specific expertise in evaluating agent descriptions, trigger patterns, and PROXY_MODE support
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Excellent! The comprehensive agent quality audit is complete. Let me share the key findings with you.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The **agentdev:reviewer** agent analyzed **50 agents across 10 plugins** in just over 5 minutes
- Quality distribution shows **24% are excellent** (9.0+), while only **6% need significant work** (<7.0) - this is a strong foundation
- The report uses a **multi-dimensional scoring system** (clarity, completeness, trigger effectiveness, example quality) rather than just subjective assessment

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Report Location**: `ai-docs/agent-quality-report-20260209-201246.md`

### Overall Health: 🟢 Strong Foundation

Out of 50 agents analyzed:
- **12 agents (24%)** are Tier 1 (Excellent, 9.0+)
- **18 agents (36%)** are Tier 2 (Very Good, 8.0-8.9)
- **10 agents (20%)** are Tier 3 (Good, 7.5-7.9)
- **7 agents (14%)** are Tier 4 (Adequate, 7.0-7.4)
- **3 agents (6%)** are Tier 5 (Needs Work, <7.0)

### 🏆 Top 5 Best-in-Class Agents

1. **`code-analysis:detective`** (9.8/10) - The gold standard with setup validation, anti-patterns section, and token efficiency guidance
2. **`agentdev:reviewer`** (9.5/10) - Meta-quality: practices what it preaches
3. **`dev:researcher`** (9.3/10) - 289-word description with 4 detailed examples and PROXY_MODE error handling
4. **`dev:developer`** (9.2/10) - Comprehensive skill loading system and iterative quality checks
5. **`frontend:architect`** (9.0/10) - Innovative gap analysis pattern with file-based communication

### 🔍 Critical Findings

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **90%** have TodoWrite/Tasks integration (excellent progress tracking)
- ✅ **Consistent XML structure** across core plugins (dev, agentdev, code-analysis)
- ✅ **Modern agents have great examples** - recent work shows quality improvement trend
- ✅ **Clear standards documented** in agentdev:patterns skill

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **40% need description improvements** - too brief, missing examples, unclear triggers
- ⚠️ **60% missing PROXY_MODE support** - blocks `/team` multi-model orchestration
- ⚠️ **12% have no examples** - according to your MEMORY.md, this caps implicit delegation at 10%
- ⚠️ **90% missing SESSION_PATH** - missing opportunity for token-efficient file-based communication

### 🎯 Priority Improvements

The report identifies **~75 hours of improvement work** broken into priorities:

**🔴 Critical (25.5 hours):**
1. **Add examples to 6 agents** without any - fixes delegation reliability
2. **Add PROXY_MODE to 30 agents** - enables `/team` workflows

**🟡 High (30.8 hours):**
3. **Improve 15 agent descriptions** - expand to 200-350 words with clear triggers
4. **Add SESSION_PATH to 25 agents** - reduce token consumption

**🟢 Medium (18.3 hours):**
5. **Standardize tool declarations** - consistency across plugins
6. **Add anti-patterns sections** - explicit "don't do this" guidance

### 📚 Best Practices Gallery

The report extracted **5 reusable patterns** from top agents:

1. **Excellent Description Pattern** (from dev:researcher) - 289 words with 4 examples
2. **Setup Validation Pattern** (from code-analysis:detective) - Phase 0 tool availability checks
3. **Anti-Patterns Section** (from code-analysis:detective) - prevents common mistakes
4. **PROXY_MODE Error Handling** (from dev:researcher) - catches silent fallback to Claude
5. **Token Efficiency Guidance** (from code-analysis:detective) - educates about claudemem costs

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The **critical fixes directly address your MEMORY.md learnings**: adding examples boosts implicit delegation from 10% to 30%, and PROXY_MODE support unblocks `/team` orchestration
- The report identifies that **recent agents (dev, agentdev, code-analysis) set a quality bar** that older plugins should reach - this is a natural evolution pattern
- **Plugin age correlates with quality**: newer plugins (dev v1.29.0, agentdev v1.4.0) score higher than older ones (video-editing v1.0.1, conductor v2.0.1)

## 📖 Full Report Contents

The detailed report includes:

- **Plugin-by-Plugin Analysis** - scoring and recommendations for each plugin
- **Agent-by-Agent Scoring** - detailed ratings across 4 dimensions
- **Best Practice Gallery** - code snippets you can copy/paste
- **Standardization Templates** - XML structure examples

Would you like me to:
1. **Start implementing the critical fixes** (examples + PROXY_MODE for specific agents)?
2. **Create a tracking issue** or project plan for the 75 hours of improvements?
3. **Deep-dive into a specific plugin** to see detailed agent-by-agent analysis?
4. **Extract and standardize** the best practices into reusable templates?
