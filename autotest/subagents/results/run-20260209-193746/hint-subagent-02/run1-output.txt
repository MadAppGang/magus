I'll launch a background security audit subagent to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- Using the `dev:audit` agent in background mode allows comprehensive security scanning without blocking the current session
- The agent will check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, secrets, and code quality issues across the entire codebase
- Background execution means we can continue working while the audit runs, and results will be written to the specified file
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
I see that `dev:audit` is a skill (slash command) not a subagent. Let me use the appropriate agent for this security analysis task - the `code-analysis:detective` agent is designed for comprehensive codebase investigation.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- `dev:audit` is invoked as a skill (`/dev:audit`) but we need a Task agent for background execution
- The `code-analysis:detective` agent is perfect for this - it specializes in deep codebase analysis and investigation
- Background tasks write output to files, allowing us to retrieve results asynchronously
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Perfect! I've launched a comprehensive security audit that's now running in the background.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The detective agent uses claudemem for semantic code search, making it highly effective at finding security patterns across large codebases
- Background execution allows the audit to run independently while you continue other work
- The agent will systematically scan for all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities plus hardcoded secrets
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

**What's happening:**
The security audit is scanning the entire codebase for:
- 🔐 Hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- 💉 SQL injection vulnerabilities
- 🚨 XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vectors
- ⚡ Command injection risks
- 🛡️ Other OWASP Top 10 issues

**When complete:**
- Results will be written to `ai-docs/security-audit.md`
- You'll be automatically notified when the audit finishes
- The report will include severity ratings, specific file locations, code snippets, and remediation guidance

You can continue working on other tasks while the audit runs. I'll let you know as soon as it's complete!
