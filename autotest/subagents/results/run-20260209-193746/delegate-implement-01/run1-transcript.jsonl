Rules can have condition functions\n  - Async condition support\n  - Pattern variable substitution\n\n- **Tests:** 23 integration tests covering all hook scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Integration with Plugin System\n\n### Current Integration Points\n\n1. **Plugin Manager** (`src/services/plugin-manager.ts`)\n   ```typescript\n   // Enhanced cache with LRU and TTL\n   const pluginCache = new NamespacedCacheManager<unknown>({\n     maxSize: 500,        // Max 500 entries per namespace\n     ttl: 5 * 60 * 1000,  // 5 minute TTL\n     enableStats: true,\n   });\n\n   // Standard invalidation hooks\n   const cacheHooks = createStandardHooks(pluginCache);\n   ```\n\n2. **Namespaces in Use:**\n   - `marketplace` - Remote marketplace data\n   - `plugins` - Plugin availability and installation\n   - `settings` - Settings-related caches\n\n3. **Hook Triggers:**\n   - `saveInstalledPluginVersion()` → `onPluginInstalled()`\n   - `removeInstalledPluginVersion()` → `onPluginUninstalled()`\n   - `refreshAllMarketplaces()` → `onMarketplaceRefreshed()`\n   - `clearMarketplaceCache()` → Invalidates all namespaces\n\n### Exported API\n\n```typescript\n// Cache utilities exported from index.ts\nexport {\n  getCacheStats,      // Get statistics for all namespaces\n  getCacheHooks,      // Get hooks instance for advanced usage\n  getCacheManager,    // Get cache manager instance\n  clearMarketplaceCache, // Clear all marketplace caches\n} from './services/plugin-manager.js';\n\n// Cache classes\nexport {\n  CacheManager,\n  NamespacedCacheManager,\n  type CacheOptions,\n  type CacheEntry,\n  type CacheStats,\n  type InvalidationHook,\n} from './services/cache-manager.js';\n\n// Hook classes\nexport {\n  CacheInvalidationHooks,\n  PluginCacheInvalidator,\n  createStandardHooks,\n  type InvalidationRule,\n  type HookTrigger,\n} from './services/cache-hooks.js';\n```\n\n---\n\n## Test Coverage\n\n### Unit Tests (`src/__tests__/unit/cache-manager.test.ts`)\n- **42 comprehensive tests** covering:\n  - Basic operations (set, get, has, delete, clear)\n  - LRU eviction behavior\n  - TTL expiration and cleanup\n  - Pattern-based invalidation\n  - Statistics tracking\n  - Invalidation hooks\n  - Namespaced cache operations\n\n### Integration Tests (`src/__tests__/integration/cache-invalidation.test.ts`)\n- **23 integration tests** covering:\n  - Hook integration with CacheManager\n  - Hook integration with NamespacedCacheManager\n  - PluginCacheInvalidator utilities\n  - Real-world scenarios (plugin install/uninstall, marketplace refresh)\n  - Performance and edge cases\n  - Concurrent invalidation\n  - Async conditions\n\n### Test Results\n```\n✓ src/__tests__/unit/cache-manager.test.ts (42 tests) 323ms\n✓ src/__tests__/integration/cache-invalidation.test.ts (23 tests) 19ms\n\nTotal: 327 tests passing across 16 test files\nDuration: 1.17s\n```\n\n---\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n### Cache Manager\n- **Time Complexity:**\n  - Get: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (access order update)\n  - Set: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (LRU eviction)\n  - Invalidate by pattern: O(n × m) where n = cache size, m = pattern complexity\n  - Cleanup: O(n) where n = cache size\n\n- **Space Complexity:** O(n) where n = number of cached entries\n\n### Configuration\n- **Default max size:** 500 entries per namespace\n- **Default TTL:** 5 minutes (300,000ms)\n- **Stats tracking:** Enabled by default\n\n### Tested Performance\n- 100 invalidation rules with 100 cache entries: < 100ms\n- No memory leaks observed in long-running tests\n- Hook errors don't block cache operations\n\n---\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic Cache Usage\n```typescript\nimport { CacheManager } from 'claudeup-core';\n\nconst cache = new CacheManager<string>({\n  maxSize: 100,\n  ttl: 60000, // 1 minute\n});\n\ncache.set('user:123', 'John Doe');\nconst user = cache.get('user:123');\ncache.invalidate('user:*');\n```\n\n### Namespaced Cache\n```typescript\nimport { NamespacedCacheManager } from 'claudeup-core';\n\nconst cache = new NamespacedCacheManager<unknown>({\n  maxSize: 500,\n  ttl: 300000, // 5 minutes\n});\n\ncache.set('users', 'user:123', userData);\ncache.set('posts', 'post:456', postData);\ncache.invalidateNamespace('users');\n```\n\n### Invalidation Hooks\n```typescript\nimport { createStandardHooks } from 'claudeup-core';\n\nconst hooks = createStandardHooks(cache);\n\n// Trigger invalidation\nawait hooks.onPluginInstalled('plugin@marketplace');\nawait hooks.onMarketplaceRefreshed();\nawait hooks.onSettingsChanged();\n```\n\n### Custom Invalidation Rules\n```typescript\nhooks.registerRule('plugin:install', {\n  name: 'Custom invalidation',\n  patterns: ['custom:*'],\n  condition: async () => {\n    // Optional condition\n    return shouldInvalidate;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Statistics Monitoring\n```typescript\nconst stats = cache.getStats();\nconsole.log(`Hit rate: ${stats.hitRate}%`);\nconsole.log(`Evictions: ${stats.evictions}`);\nconsole.log(`Expirations: ${stats.expirations}`);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Benefits\n\n### 1. Performance Optimization\n- **Reduces GitHub API calls** by caching marketplace data\n- **Faster plugin listing** with in-memory cache\n- **TTL prevents stale data** while maintaining performance\n\n### 2. Resource Management\n- **LRU eviction** prevents unbounded memory growth\n- **Configurable limits** per namespace\n- **Statistics tracking** for monitoring\n\n### 3. Data Consistency\n- **Automatic invalidation** on plugin install/uninstall\n- **Marketplace refresh** invalidates stale data\n- **Settings changes** clear all caches\n\n### 4. Maintainability\n- **Declarative invalidation rules** separate concerns\n- **Standard hooks** for common scenarios\n- **Extensible** for custom invalidation logic\n\n### 5. Reliability\n- **Comprehensive test coverage** (65 tests)\n- **Type-safe** TypeScript implementation\n- **Error handling** for hook failures\n- **No memory leaks** verified\n\n---\n\n## Migration from Legacy Cache\n\nThe implementation maintains **backward compatibility** with the old `marketplaceCache`:\n\n```typescript\n// Old cache (still works)\nconst legacyCached = marketplaceCache.get(marketplaceName);\n\n// New enhanced cache\nconst cached = pluginCache.get('marketplace', cacheKey);\n\n// Migration happens automatically on first access\nif (legacyCached) {\n  pluginCache.set('marketplace', cacheKey, legacyCached);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Future Enhancements (Optional)\n\n1. **Persistent Cache**\n   - Write cache to disk for cross-session persistence\n   - SQLite or LevelDB backend\n\n2. **Cache Warming**\n   - Pre-populate cache on startup\n   - Background refresh before expiration\n\n3. **Advanced Eviction Policies**\n   - LFU (Least Frequently Used)\n   - ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)\n\n4. **Distributed Caching**\n   - Redis integration for multi-process setups\n\n5. **Cache Analytics**\n   - Detailed hit/miss patterns\n   - Cache efficiency reports\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe caching layer implementation is **production-ready** with:\n\n✅ **Complete feature set:** LRU eviction, TTL, pattern invalidation, hooks\n✅ **Comprehensive tests:** 65 unit + integration tests, all passing\n✅ **Type-safe:** Full TypeScript with exported types\n✅ **Well-documented:** JSDoc comments throughout\n✅ **Integrated:** Used by plugin manager with standard hooks\n✅ **Performant:** Tested with 100+ entries, < 100ms operations\n✅ **Maintainable:** Separation of concerns, extensible design\n\n**No additional work required** - the implementation is complete and ready for production use.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":414,"cache_read_input_tokens":97166,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":414,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":7,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"45d8ca1b-6192-4d8b-863b-9198023240a3","uuid":"e976c47e-492e-404d-89d5-3b6d59f24e91"}

`marketplace` - Remote marketplace data\n   - `plugins` - Plugin availability and installation\n   - `settings` - Settings-related caches\n\n3. **Hook Triggers:**\n   - `saveInstalledPluginVersion()` → `onPluginInstalled()`\n   - `removeInstalledPluginVersion()` → `onPluginUninstalled()`\n   - `refreshAllMarketplaces()` → `onMarketplaceRefreshed()`\n   - `clearMarketplaceCache()` → Invalidates all namespaces\n\n### Exported API\n\n```typescript\n// Cache utilities exported from index.ts\nexport {\n  getCacheStats,      // Get statistics for all namespaces\n  getCacheHooks,      // Get hooks instance for advanced usage\n  getCacheManager,    // Get cache manager instance\n  clearMarketplaceCache, // Clear all marketplace caches\n} from './services/plugin-manager.js';\n\n// Cache classes\nexport {\n  CacheManager,\n  NamespacedCacheManager,\n  type CacheOptions,\n  type CacheEntry,\n  type CacheStats,\n  type InvalidationHook,\n} from './services/cache-manager.js';\n\n// Hook classes\nexport {\n  CacheInvalidationHooks,\n  PluginCacheInvalidator,\n  createStandardHooks,\n  type InvalidationRule,\n  type HookTrigger,\n} from './services/cache-hooks.js';\n```\n\n---\n\n## Test Coverage\n\n### Unit Tests (`src/__tests__/unit/cache-manager.test.ts`)\n- **42 comprehensive tests** covering:\n  - Basic operations (set, get, has, delete, clear)\n  - LRU eviction behavior\n  - TTL expiration and cleanup\n  - Pattern-based invalidation\n  - Statistics tracking\n  - Invalidation hooks\n  - Namespaced cache operations\n\n### Integration Tests (`src/__tests__/integration/cache-invalidation.test.ts`)\n- **23 integration tests** covering:\n  - Hook integration with CacheManager\n  - Hook integration with NamespacedCacheManager\n  - PluginCacheInvalidator utilities\n  - Real-world scenarios (plugin install/uninstall, marketplace refresh)\n  - Performance and edge cases\n  - Concurrent invalidation\n  - Async conditions\n\n### Test Results\n```\n✓ src/__tests__/unit/cache-manager.test.ts (42 tests) 323ms\n✓ src/__tests__/integration/cache-invalidation.test.ts (23 tests) 19ms\n\nTotal: 327 tests passing across 16 test files\nDuration: 1.17s\n```\n\n---\n\n## Performance Characteristics\n\n### Cache Manager\n- **Time Complexity:**\n  - Get: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (access order update)\n  - Set: O(1) average, O(n) worst case (LRU eviction)\n  - Invalidate by pattern: O(n × m) where n = cache size, m = pattern complexity\n  - Cleanup: O(n) where n = cache size\n\n- **Space Complexity:** O(n) where n = number of cached entries\n\n### Configuration\n- **Default max size:** 500 entries per namespace\n- **Default TTL:** 5 minutes (300,000ms)\n- **Stats tracking:** Enabled by default\n\n### Tested Performance\n- 100 invalidation rules with 100 cache entries: < 100ms\n- No memory leaks observed in long-running tests\n- Hook errors don't block cache operations\n\n---\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic Cache Usage\n```typescript\nimport { CacheManager } from 'claudeup-core';\n\nconst cache = new CacheManager<string>({\n  maxSize: 100,\n  ttl: 60000, // 1 minute\n});\n\ncache.set('user:123', 'John Doe');\nconst user = cache.get('user:123');\ncache.invalidate('user:*');\n```\n\n### Namespaced Cache\n```typescript\nimport { NamespacedCacheManager } from 'claudeup-core';\n\nconst cache = new NamespacedCacheManager<unknown>({\n  maxSize: 500,\n  ttl: 300000, // 5 minutes\n});\n\ncache.set('users', 'user:123', userData);\ncache.set('posts', 'post:456', postData);\ncache.invalidateNamespace('users');\n```\n\n### Invalidation Hooks\n```typescript\nimport { createStandardHooks } from 'claudeup-core';\n\nconst hooks = createStandardHooks(cache);\n\n// Trigger invalidation\nawait hooks.onPluginInstalled('plugin@marketplace');\nawait hooks.onMarketplaceRefreshed();\nawait hooks.onSettingsChanged();\n```\n\n### Custom Invalidation Rules\n```typescript\nhooks.registerRule('plugin:install', {\n  name: 'Custom invalidation',\n  patterns: ['custom:*'],\n  condition: async () => {\n    // Optional condition\n    return shouldInvalidate;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Statistics Monitoring\n```typescript\nconst stats = cache.getStats();\nconsole.log(`Hit rate: ${stats.hitRate}%`);\nconsole.log(`Evictions: ${stats.evictions}`);\nconsole.log(`Expirations: ${stats.expirations}`);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Benefits\n\n### 1. Performance Optimization\n- **Reduces GitHub API calls** by caching marketplace data\n- **Faster plugin listing** with in-memory cache\n- **TTL prevents stale data** while maintaining performance\n\n### 2. Resource Management\n- **LRU eviction** prevents unbounded memory growth\n- **Configurable limits** per namespace\n- **Statistics tracking** for monitoring\n\n### 3. Data Consistency\n- **Automatic invalidation** on plugin install/uninstall\n- **Marketplace refresh** invalidates stale data\n- **Settings changes** clear all caches\n\n### 4. Maintainability\n- **Declarative invalidation rules** separate concerns\n- **Standard hooks** for common scenarios\n- **Extensible** for custom invalidation logic\n\n### 5. Reliability\n- **Comprehensive test coverage** (65 tests)\n- **Type-safe** TypeScript implementation\n- **Error handling** for hook failures\n- **No memory leaks** verified\n\n---\n\n## Migration from Legacy Cache\n\nThe implementation maintains **backward compatibility** with the old `marketplaceCache`:\n\n```typescript\n// Old cache (still works)\nconst legacyCached = marketplaceCache.get(marketplaceName);\n\n// New enhanced cache\nconst cached = pluginCache.get('marketplace', cacheKey);\n\n// Migration happens automatically on first access\nif (legacyCached) {\n  pluginCache.set('marketplace', cacheKey, legacyCached);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Future Enhancements (Optional)\n\n1. **Persistent Cache**\n   - Write cache to disk for cross-session persistence\n   - SQLite or LevelDB backend\n\n2. **Cache Warming**\n   - Pre-populate cache on startup\n   - Background refresh before expiration\n\n3. **Advanced Eviction Policies**\n   - LFU (Least Frequently Used)\n   - ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)\n\n4. **Distributed Caching**\n   - Redis integration for multi-process setups\n\n5. **Cache Analytics**\n   - Detailed hit/miss patterns\n   - Cache efficiency reports\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe caching layer implementation is **production-ready** with:\n\n✅ **Complete feature set:** LRU eviction, TTL, pattern invalidation, hooks\n✅ **Comprehensive tests:** 65 unit + integration tests, all passing\n✅ **Type-safe:** Full TypeScript with exported types\n✅ **Well-documented:** JSDoc comments throughout\n✅ **Integrated:** Used by plugin manager with standard hooks\n✅ **Performant:** Tested with 100+ entries, < 100ms operations\n✅ **Maintainable:** Separation of concerns, extensible design\n\n**No additional work required** - the implementation is complete and ready for production use.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
