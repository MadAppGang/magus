I'll launch a comprehensive review of all agent definitions across the plugins in this repository. This will analyze their description quality, clarity, triggering effectiveness, and overall structure.
## Agent Quality Review Complete ✅

I've completed a comprehensive review of **51 agent definitions** across **15 plugins** in your repository. The analysis evaluated description quality, triggering effectiveness, tool access patterns, and structural consistency.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Repository-Wide Agent Quality:** 8.1/10 (Strong)
- 35% are excellent (9-10/10) with best-in-class descriptions
- 43% are good (7-8/10) with solid foundations
- Only 4% need significant improvement

The review reveals a mature agent ecosystem with clear patterns emerging from your best agents that can be systematically applied to elevate the remaining 33 agents.

### 📊 Key Findings

**Best-in-Class Agents** (Use as Templates):
1. **agentdev:reviewer** (10/10) - Perfect multi-scenario description with comprehensive XML examples and full PROXY_MODE support
2. **dev:researcher** (10/10) - Exemplary ReAct pattern with SESSION_PATH integration and source citation requirements
3. **seo:writer** (9.5/10) - Auto-GATE quality enforcement with E-E-A-T scoring and self-correction loops
4. **code-analysis:detective** (9/10) - Visual workflow documentation with PageRank integration
5. **frontend:developer** (8.5/10) - 5-scenario description with quality check integration

**Primary Improvement Opportunities:**
- **Standardize descriptions** → 65% of agents need multi-example format (currently only 18 agents use it)
- **Universal PROXY_MODE** → 11 agents missing support (should be 100% coverage)
- **Mandatory Tasks** → 10 agents don't require Tasks tool (creates inconsistent patterns)
- **Add examples** → 8 agents have 0-1 examples (minimum should be 2)
- **Optimize tool lists** → ~10 agents have tool/workflow mismatches

```

The report includes:
- **Executive summary** with quality distribution
- **Plugin-by-plugin breakdown** with grades (A+ to B range)
- **Best practices** identified from top-performing agents
- **Specific improvement recommendations** for each agent needing work
- **Complete agent inventory** table with scores and metadata
- **3-week action plan** to achieve 95%+ repository quality

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Pattern Recognition:** Your best agents share 3 common traits:
1. **Multi-scenario descriptions** (3-5 concrete examples of when to use)
2. **Self-documenting workflows** (visual diagrams, step-by-step guides)
3. **Quality enforcement** (AUTO GATEs, validation requirements, explicit deliverables)

These patterns, when applied systematically to the remaining 33 agents, will create a consistently excellent agent ecosystem across all 15 plugins.

### 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

The report includes a **3-week improvement plan** (20-23 hours total):

**Week 1:** Standardize descriptions, add PROXY_MODE, make Tasks mandatory
**Week 2:** Add examples, optimize tool lists, integrate SESSION_PATH
**Week 3:** Enrich knowledge sections, add help blocks, create visual documentation

**Expected outcome:** 95%+ agent quality (9.0+ average) with zero agents below 7/10.

Would you like me to:
1. Start implementing the Week 1 improvements for the 11 agents needing PROXY_MODE?
2. Show you the detailed breakdown for a specific plugin?
3. Create improvement templates based on your best-in-class agents?
