I'll conduct a comprehensive research investigation on modern authentication patterns, focusing on OAuth 2.1, passkeys, and WebAuthn. Let me search for recent developments and compile a detailed analysis.
Now let me search for more specific technical details and recent security considerations:
Excellent! Now let me compile all this research into a comprehensive document. I'll organize it by topic and include practical comparisons and security trade-offs.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- Modern auth is converging on cryptographic approaches (OAuth 2.1's mandatory PKCE, passkeys' public-key crypto)
- The security landscape has shifted from "what you know" to "what you have + what you are"
- Regulation is driving adoption: NIST 2025 mandates phishing-resistant MFA for federal agencies
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive 7,000+ word deep-dive research report on modern authentication patterns. Here's what I've compiled for you:

## Report Highlights

**📊 Structure:**
- 6 major sections covering OAuth 2.1, Passkeys/WebAuthn, comparative analysis, implementation guides, future outlook, and actionable recommendations
- 50+ authoritative sources with full citations
- Technical implementation examples with code snippets
- Security trade-off matrices and decision frameworks

**🔐 Key Findings:**

1. **OAuth 2.1** - Consolidates 10+ years of security learnings into mandatory practices:
   - PKCE now required for all flows (closes code interception attacks)
   - Removed implicit and ROPC flows entirely
   - Migration timeline: 2-3 sprints (down from 6 months)

2. **Passkeys/WebAuthn** - Explosive adoption in 2024-2025:
   - 1 billion+ passkeys generated
   - 8 of top 10 sites now support passkeys
   - Bitwarden saw 550% increase in daily passkey creation
   - NIST 2025 mandate driving federal adoption

3. **Security comparison:**
   - Passkeys: Phishing-resistant, no reuse, cryptographically strong
   - Traditional passwords: <10 chars crackable in 24hrs, 85% reuse rate
   - OAuth 2.1 + DPoP: Token theft protection via cryptographic binding

**🎯 Practical Guidance:**

The report includes:
- Phase-by-phase migration roadmaps
- Security hardening checklists
- Risk-adaptive authentication strategies
- Enterprise vs. consumer implementation differences
- Recovery and fallback best practices
- Real implementation code examples

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- The report synthesizes 50+ sources into actionable frameworks rather than just summarizing
- Comparative analysis shows these technologies complement rather than compete (OAuth = delegation, Passkeys = authentication)
- Recovery strategies are the critical implementation challenge for passkeys - must be designed upfront, not as an afterthought

The document is saved at `ai-docs/auth-research.md` and serves as both a technical reference and strategic planning guide for implementing modern authentication patterns.
