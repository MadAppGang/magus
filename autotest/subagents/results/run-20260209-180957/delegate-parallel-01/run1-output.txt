I'll dispatch three parallel research agents to investigate these topics independently, with each writing findings to separate files.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Parallel agent orchestration**: Using multiple Task agents simultaneously maximizes efficiency for independent research tasks
- **Session isolation pattern**: Each agent writes to a unique file in `ai-docs/sessions/` to prevent collision, following the multi-model workflow patterns established in this codebase
- **Agent selection**: Using `dev:deep-research` agents since they're designed for comprehensive research with convergence-based finalization
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`
Perfect! All three research agents have completed their work in parallel. Here's what was accomplished:

## Research Complete - Three Parallel Investigations

### 📊 **1. GraphQL vs REST Performance** 
**File:** `ai-docs/sessions/parallel-research-graphql-rest-1770622895.md`

**Key Takeaways:**
- **GraphQL wins** for mobile apps (36% faster), nested data (71% faster), complex dashboards
- **REST wins** for simple CRUD (15-30% faster), caching (38% better hit rates), public APIs
- **Real data** from Netflix, GitHub, Shopify, PayPal showing production performance
- **42% of companies** use hybrid approach - both technologies together

**Standout Benchmark:** Shopify reduced bandwidth by 48% (461KB vs 892KB per session) with GraphQL

### 🔌 **2. WebSocket Scaling Patterns**
**File:** `ai-docs/sessions/parallel-research-websocket-scaling-1770622897.md`

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Single server limit:** ~50,000 concurrent connections
- **Scaling strategy:** Sticky sessions + Redis Pub/Sub works for 95% of use cases
- **Message brokers compared:** Redis (fast), RabbitMQ (reliable), Kafka (high throughput)
- **Cloud solutions:** AWS API Gateway WebSocket, Azure SignalR for managed scaling
- **Architecture patterns** for small (1k-10k), medium (10k-100k), and large scale (100k-1M+ connections)

**Critical Insight:** Each WebSocket connection uses 30-50KB memory - plan capacity accordingly!

### ⚡ **3. Edge Computing for API Gateways**
**File:** `ai-docs/sessions/parallel-research-edge-api-gateways-1770622901.md`

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Latency reduction:** 50-87% improvement globally (450ms → 60ms for Asia from US East)
- **Cost savings:** 75-91% reduction at scale ($11 vs $113/month for 10M requests)
- **Platform winner:** Cloudflare Workers ($0.50/M requests, <1ms cold starts)
- **Best for:** Authentication (8ms vs 120ms), rate limiting, caching, DDoS protection
- **Limitations:** CPU time (10-50ms), memory (128-512MB), debugging complexity

**Standout Stat:** Edge DDoS protection can absorb 50M-100M+ requests/sec before traffic reaches your backend

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Parallel execution efficiency**: All three agents ran simultaneously, completing in ~7.3 minutes total (vs ~22 minutes if sequential)
- **Agent resource usage**: Combined 160,766 tokens across agents - this distributed approach kept the main context clean while gathering extensive research
- **Session isolation pattern**: Each agent wrote to timestamped files preventing any collision risk, following the `ai-docs/sessions/` convention from the multimodel plugin patterns
`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`

All research files are ready for review in the `ai-docs/sessions/` directory with comprehensive findings, benchmarks, code examples, and actionable recommendations!
